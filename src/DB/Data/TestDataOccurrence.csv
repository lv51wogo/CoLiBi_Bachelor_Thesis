animal;Animalia;organism;PG10002;30.0;there was nothing to be seen, save that many of the branches were bent down, and broken, as though some animal had made a lair there, at no very previous date.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10002;30.0;thus, a day came, when, throwing thoughts and fancies adrift, i procured a rope from the house, and, having made it fast to a stout tree, at the top of the rift, and some little distance back from the pit edge, let the other end down into the cleft, until it dangled right across the mouth of the dark hole.

pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;31.0;at this movement, pepper, who had been eyeing my actions, watchfully, rose to his feet, and ran to me, with a half bark, half wail, it seemed to me, of warning.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;31.0;yet, having made up my mind, i had no intention of giving up the attempt, and, with a sharp word to pepper, to release me, i continued my descent, leaving the poor old fellow at the top, barking and crying like a forsaken pup.

pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;33.0;then, even as i stood, pepper gave a sudden howl, that was taken up by the echoes, and repeated with ghastly variations, dying away, slowly.
dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10002;33.0;with a quick movement, i held aloft the one candle that i had kept, and glanced down at the dog, at the same moment, i seemed to hear a noise, like a diabolical chuckle, rise up from the hitherto, silent depths of the pit.

pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;33.0;i started, then, i recollected that it was, probably, the echo of pepper's howl.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;33.0;pepper had moved away from me, up the passage, a few steps, he was nosing along the rocky floor, and i thought i heard him lapping.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;33.0;again, pepper gave vent to that deep-drawn howl, and, running at me, seized my coat, and attempted to drag me up the path toward the entrance.

pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;33.0;pepper had, fortunately, followed me as i leapt for the ledge, and now, very much subdued, kept close behind.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;33.0;then, with a call to pepper, i stepped out into the flood, using the gun as a staff.

pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;34.0;if my impressions are correct, i must have been washed down to the very brink of that awful chasm, before pepper managed to bring me to a standstill.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;34.0;and there was i, without my helpful gun, without light, and sadly confused, with the water deepening, depending solely upon my old friend pepper, to help me out of that hellish place.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;34.0;naturally, it was the only way in which i could have sustained my position a moment, for even old pepper could not have held me long against that terrific strain, without assistance, however blind, from me.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;34.0;slowly, furiously, almost hopelessly, i strove, and that faithful pepper led me, dragged me, upward and onward, until, at last, ahead i saw a gleam of blessed light.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;34.0;seizing the end, i knotted it securely 'round pepper's body, then, summoning up the last remnant of my strength, i commenced to swarm up the side of the cliff.

pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;40.0;once, i turned from the window, and glanced at pepper.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;41.0;all this while had pepper slept.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;41.0;for the space of, perhaps a minute, i stared down at the shapeless heap, that had once been pepper.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;41.0;suddenly, as my glance fell again upon pepper's remains, i stood still, and gave voice to my confusion--questioning, aloud, whether the years were, indeed, passing, whether this, which i had taken to be a form of vision, was, in truth, a reality.

pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;42.0;i looked at the little dust-heap that had once been pepper.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;43.0;i thought of pepper, and wondered how it was that i had not followed his fate.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG10002;43.0;undoubtedly, atoms of the old, decayed furniture helped to swell its bulk, and, somewhere among it all, mouldered the long-ago-dead pepper.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10002;49.0;with increased size, its color became more impressive, reminding me of a huge emerald, scintillating rays of fire across the world.
ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10002;50.0;for a time, fear held me, and i prayed, wildly and incoherently, for some ray of light with which to dispel the cold blackness that enveloped the world.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;1.0;book 2 of the little ottleys,by ada leverson 1912 to robert ross chapter i a verbal invitation because edith had not been feeling very well, that seemed no reason why she should be the centre of interest, and bruce, with that jealousy of the privileges of the invalid and in that curious spirit of rivalry which his wife had so often observed, had started, with enterprise, an indisposition of his own, as if to divert public attention.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;1.0;then he received a letter from edith, speaking with deference and solicitude of bruce's rheumatism, entreating him to do the cure thoroughly, and suggesting that they should call the little girl matilda, after a rich and sainted--though still living--aunt of edith's.
rosebud;Cercis;organism;PG10021;1.0;it appeared from the detailed description that the new daughter had, as a matter of course,and at two days old,, long golden hair, far below her waist, sweeping lashes and pencilled brows, a rosebud mouth, an intellectual forehead, chiselled features and a tall, elegant figure.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;1.0;overwhelmed with joy at the advent of such a paragon, and horrified at edith's choice of a name, bruce had replied at once by wire, impulsively,'certainly not matilda i would rather she were called aspasia.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;1.0;edith read this expression of feeling on a colourless telegraph form, and as she was, at knightsbridge, unable to hear the ironical tone of the message she took it literally.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;1.0;'but it's not a pretty name,' objected edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;1.0;sometimes edith thought that her daughter's names were decidedly a failure--aspasia by mistake, matilda through obstinacy, and dilly by accident.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;2.0;one afternoon edith was talking to the telephone in a voice of agonised entreaty that would have melted the hardest of hearts, but did not seem to have much effect on the exchange, which, evidently, was not responsive to pathos that day.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;2.0;edith rang off.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;2.0;'it's really rather wonderful, edith, what that sandow exerciser has done for me!
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;2.0;said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;2.0;'only a silver tea-service, and a couple of salvers,' said edith, in a low voice....
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;2.0;he calmed down fairly soon and said,'edith, i have some news for you.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;2.0;edith shook her head and frowned.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;3.0;what shall you wear, edith?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;3.0;'what on earth's that thing in your hair, edith?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;3.0;'don't be trivial, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;3.0;edith agreed that she knew of no really suitable place where she could buy a new evening dress at eight-thirty on sunday evening.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;3.0;'you are perfectly right,' said edith,'the bankruptcy of an old friend and colleague could be no satisfaction to any man.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;3.0;bruce, in trying to ring the bell, unfortunately turned out all the electric light in the house, and was standing alone in despair in the dark when, fortunately the porter, who had been out to post a letter, ran back, and turned up the light again.... 'i shouldn't have thought they could play musical crambo here, 'he called out to edith while he was waiting.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4.0;edith suggested doubtfully.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4.0;an idea occurred to edith, and she asked for a directory.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4.0;'i think we'd better tell them what has happened,' said edith, 'it will make them laugh.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4.0;'now, now, don't be bitter, edith dear--never be bitter--life has its ups and downs....
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4.0;'i'm sure you are,' said edith, 'it could be no possible satisfaction to you to know that a friend and colleague of yours is either distressingly hard up or painfully penurious.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4.0;'i could tell you what you are,' said edith, 'but i won't, because now you must take me to the carlton.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4.0;edith found it difficult to see the point.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4.0;this, edith said, would have been excellent, provided that the parlourmaid hadn't told them that she and bruce had arrived about a quarter to ten on sunday evening and asked if the mitchells had begun dinner.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4.0;bruce was in good spirits again, he was pleased too, because he was going to the theatre that evening with edith and vincy, to see a play that he thought wouldn't be very good.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;5.0;edith opened the door and wanted to know what the row was about.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;5.0;'it's all right, bruce,' edith laughed.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG10021;5.0;archie dear, i'll take you to the zoological gardens and we'll see lots of other animals.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;5.0;he was very devoted to both edith and bruce, and he was a confidant of both.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;5.0;he sometimes said to edith that he felt he was just what was wanted in the little home, an intimate stranger coming in occasionally with a fresh atmosphere was often of great value,as, for instance, now,in calming or averting storms.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;6.0;he delighted in bruce, but had with edith, of course, more mutual understanding and intellectual sympathy, and though they met constantly, his friendship with her had never been misunderstood.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;6.0;vincy was pleased with the story of the mitchells that edith told him, and she was glad to hear that he knew the mitchells and had been to the house.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;7.0;this question was considered one of interest,--so edith had a great many admirers.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;7.0;edith was not a vain woman, not even much interested in dress, though she had a quick eye and a sure impressionistic gift for it.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG10021;7.0;at this period he spent a considerable amount of his leisure time not only in longing to see real animals, but in inventing and drawing pictures of non-existent ones--horrible creatures, or quaint creatures, for which he found the strangest names.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;7.0;it was a convention that edith should be frightened, shocked and horrified at the creatures of his imagination, while dilly privately revelled in their success.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG10021;8.0;she had a way of speaking of the animals with a smile, as a nice occupation to keep the children quiet.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;8.0;edith jumped up at once.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG10021;8.0;'mother,' archie began in a low, solemn voice, rather slowly, 'the golden quoribus is the most horrible animal, the most awful-looking animal, you ever heard of in your life!'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;10.0;almost immediately on her arrival edith noticed a tall, clean-shaven man, with smooth fair hair, observant blue eyes, and a rather humorous expression, and she instantly decided that she would try to will him to take her to dinner.,rather a superfluous effort of magnetism, since it must have been settled already by fate and the ribbons.,it was obvious from one quick glance that he shared the wish.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;10.0;edith felt happy tonight, her spirits were raised by what she felt to be an atmosphere tičde , as the french say, full of indulgence, sympathetic, relaxing, in which either cleverness or stupidity could float equally at its ease.
carnation;Dianthus caryophyllus;organism;PG10021;10.0;she was unable to help referring constantly to the hit she made in peril at manchester in 1887, nor could she ever resist speaking of the young man who sent her red carnations every day of his blighted existence for fifteen years, a pure romance, indeed, for, as she owned, he never even wished to be introduced to her.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;12.0;edith felt sure of it.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;12.0;said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;12.0;'but it doesn't always follow that a thing has happened because you do talk about it,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;12.0;mrs mitchell gladly told edith all about aylmer ross, how clever he was, how nice, how devoted to his little boy.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;13.0;'no doubt,' said edith, wishing the first wife had remained alive.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;13.0;edith now did a thing she had never done in her life before and which was entirely unlike her.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;13.0;edith was unreasonably annoyed.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;13.0;just before the party practically broke up, edith had an opportunity of saying as she passed aylmer,'i thought we were going to have a talk instead of playing games?'
rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10021;13.0;mr cricker, who had firmly refused the whole evening, in spite of abject entreaties, to dance like nijinsky, suddenly relented when everyone had forgotten all about it, and was leaping alone in the studio, while lord rye, always a great lingerer, was playing richard strauss to himself on the baby grand, and smoking a huge cigar.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;13.0;'edith,' said bruce solemnly, as they drove away, 'i've made a friend tonight.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;14.0;'i wish you wouldn't oppose me, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;15.0;'i don't like to have many things in a room,' said edith, holding out her delicate hands to the fire.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;15.0;'no, i don't think you would at all,' said edith, looking him straight in the face.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;20.0;chapter ix aylmer at the carlton aylmer had easily persuaded bruce and edith to dine with him next day, although they were engaged to the elder mrs ottley already.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21.0;such second-rate solicitudes would never even occur to edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21.0;edith asked.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21.0;'my dear edith, you can safely leave that to me.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21.0;perhaps to you, edith, it seems a rather old-fashioned idea, and i daresay you think it's rot, but to me there's something very sacred about the idea of a mother.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21.0;'circumstances alter cases, edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21.0;it really seems to me you're getting absurdly exacting and touchy, edith dear.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21.0;edith looked away.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21.0;edith sat down to the writing-table.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21.0;'right as usual, very thoughtful of you, you're a clever little woman sometimes, edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21.0;'my dear edith,' said bruce, 'you're over-anxious, i shall do nothing of the kind.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;22.0;as soon as bruce had gone out edith rang up the elder mrs ottley on the telephone, and relieved her anxiety in advance.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;22.0;edith was interested and pleased to go to the house of her new friend and to reconstruct the scene as it must have been when mrs aylmer ross had been there.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;22.0;the boy was good-looking, but not, edith thought, as handsome as aylmer.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;22.0;lady everard told edith that she felt quite like a sort of mother to aylmer.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24.0;he had never shown by word or manner any more of his sentiment than on the second occasion when they had met but edith was growing thoroughly accustomed to this new interest, and it certainly gave a zest to her existence, for she knew, as women do know, or at any rate she believed, that she had an attraction for him, which he didn't intend to give away.
green marble;Euchloe (Euchloe) naina;organism;PG10021;24.0;they went into the little dining-room, which was curiously furnished with a green marble dining-table, narrow, as in the pictures of the last supper, at which the guests could sit on one side only to be waited on from the other.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24.0;edith exclaimed.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24.0;don't worry about me, edith.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24.0;said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24.0;'at a quarter to four,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24.0;cried edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24.0;chapter x shopping chez soi edith was expecting aylmer to call that afternoon before he went away.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;this was his secret romance with a certain girl artist of whom he never spoke, although edith knew that some day he would tell her about that also.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;edith had, however, felt until now merely the agreeable excitement of knowing that a man she liked, and in whom she was immensely interested, was growing apparently devoted to her, while she had always believed that she would know how to deal with the case in such a way that it could never lead to anything more--that is to say, to more than she wished.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;edith was remarkably feminine in every attribute, in manner, in movement and in appearance, indeed, for a woman of the present day unusually and refreshingly feminine.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;edith was very clever, indeed, most ingenious, in managing practical affairs, as long as she was the director, the general of the campaign.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;but edith did not rattle her housekeeping keys, or count the coals, nor did she even go through accounts, or into the kitchen every day.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;in order to do this edith had to practise a little fraud on bruce, a justifiable and quite unselfish one.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;she gave the cook and housekeeper a quarter of her dress allowance, in addition to the wages bruce considered sufficient, because bruce believed that they could not afford more than a certain amount for a cook, while he admitted that edith, who had a few hundred pounds a year of her own, might need to spend this on dress.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;very little of it went on dress, although edith was not very economical.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;but edith was twenty-eight, and looked younger, so she could dress simply.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;this morning edith had telephoned to her friend, miss bennett, an old schoolfellow who had nothing to do, and adored commissions.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;edith, sitting by the fire or at the 'phone, gave her orders, which were always decisive, short and yet meticulous.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;miss bennett was a little late this morning, and edith had been getting quite anxious to see her.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25.0;when she at last arrived--she was a nondescript-looking girl, with a small hat squashed on her head, a serge coat and skirt, black gloves and shoes with spats--edith greeted her rather reproachfully with,'you're late, grace.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26.0;she was devoted to edith, and to a few other friends of both sexes, of whom she made idols.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26.0;'sorry, but i had to do a lot of--' 'all right,' interrupted edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26.0;edith spoke in her low, soft, impressive voice, rather slowly.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26.0;not much,' added edith, 'at the most.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26.0;'edith, what curious ideas you have!
orchid;Orchidaceae;organism;PG10021;26.0;oh, and in case i choose a light-coloured gown, get me just one very large black velvet orchid, too.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26.0;edith looked at her shoes, they were perfect, tiny, pointed and made of black sučde.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26.0;'no,' said edith, who was always frank when it was possible.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26.0;they both laughed, and edith gently pushed her friend out of the room.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26.0;when archie and dilly were out, and edith, who always got up rather early, was alone, she often passed her morning hours in reading, dreaming, playing the piano, or even in thinking.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;27.0;edith opened the boxes, cutting the string with scissors.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;27.0;'that's the one,' said edith, taking out one of a deep blue colour, like an italian sky on a coloured picture post-card.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;27.0;taking off her coat edith slipped the gown over her dress, and went to her room,followed closely by miss bennett,to see herself in the long mirror.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;27.0;said edith.
plant;Plantae;organism;PG10021;27.0;oh, and here's a little bit of stuff for the plant.
cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10021;27.0;'sorry it's cotton,' said miss bennett.
cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10021;27.0;'oh, i like cotton, if only it's not called sateen!
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;27.0;with a quiet smile, edith dismissed her.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;28.0;edith felt less mistress of the situation than she had expected.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;28.0;overpowered by a sudden impulse, aylmer seized her impetuously by the shoulders, kissed her roughly and at random before she could stop him, and said incoherently,'edith!
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;29.0;i love you, edith,' and then stood up by the mantelpiece.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;29.0;chapter xii 'the moonshine girl' the next evening bruce and edith were going to the society theatre with aylmer.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;29.0;it was their last meeting before he was to go away, edith half expected that he would put it off, but there was no change made in the plans, and they met in the box as arranged.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;29.0;at dinner before the play edith was very bright, and particularly pretty.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;29.0;and then, where's the sense, edith, in a chap leaving london where he's been the whole of the awful winter, just as it begins to be pleasant here?
cat;Felis;organism;PG10021;29.0;i can see the charm of the quaint old ideas about black cats and so forth, but i don't for one moment attach any importance to them, nor to the number thirteen, nor any of that sort of bosh.
cat;Felis;organism;PG10021;29.0;'and oddly enough--as i was trying to tell you just now, only you didn't seem to be listening--a black cat ran across my path only this afternoon.'
cat;Felis;organism;PG10021;29.0;when i say i nearly ran over it, i mean that a black cat on the same side of the taxi,if you must have details,ran away as the taxi drove on....
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30.0;'you're pleased to be facetious,' remarked edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30.0;edith got up.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30.0;'i'd show it soon enough if i felt it--if i thought i'd any cause,' said edith, 'but i didn't think i had.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30.0;i think i'm rather glad you're not musical, edith, it takes a woman away from her husband.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30.0;i thought i was,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30.0;no, edith dear, i should tell you, if you would only listen to me, to keep up your music, but you won't and there's an end of it...that souffle was really very good.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30.0;'oh yes, she's not bad,' said edith.
cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10021;30.0;the scene consisted of model cottages, a chorus of pretty girls in striped cotton were singing.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;31.0;edith smiled and nodded assent, trying to stop the incessant trickle of lady everard's leaking conversation.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;31.0;edith and aylmer looked round the house.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;31.0;'it looks like a jury,' said edith.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10021;31.0;these ladies seemed inclined to crab the play, and to find unimportant little faults with the unimportant actresses.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;31.0;the play was over, aylmer had not had a word with edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;31.0;'you're an angel if you've forgiven me,' he said, as they went out.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;32.0;no, edith, i can't stand it.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;32.0;you don't know how cruel you are with your sweetness, edith...oh, put yourself in my place!
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;32.0;'i want to speak to you now, edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33.0;'don't you believe it, edith!
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33.0;well, let me tell you, if you care to know, that it's love , and nothing else, edith....now, is there anything in the world i can do for you while i'm away?
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33.0;edith was thrilled by the passionate emotion she felt near her.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33.0;let me look at you once more....oh, edith!
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33.0;edith took away her hand.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33.0;he thought edith had more colour than usual.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33.0;edith, for whom it was a dreary anti-climax, was rather silent.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34.0;edith said.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34.0;don't you wish we were both going, edith?
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34.0;edith and bruce, from different directions, arrived at the same moment at their door, and went up together in the lift.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34.0;on the little hall-table was a letter addressed to edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34.0;'that a letter, edith?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34.0;'what could i have supposed it was, edith?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;35.0;'edith, why don't you take off your hat?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;35.0;edith got up and went towards the door.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;35.0;'edith, i'm pained and surprised at your conduct!'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;35.0;edith quickly looked at the letter.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;35.0;'the question,' said edith, in the most cool, high, irritating voice she could command, 'really, of votes for women hardly enters into our argument here.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36.0;'edith,' he said rather pathetically, trying to control himself.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36.0;edith was quite impressed at this flash of prophetic insight.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36.0;oh, edith, you're looking awfully pretty, i like that hat.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36.0;never in his life had he been opposed by edith before in this way.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36.0;he pushed the letter under the door of her room, and said through the keyhole,'edith, look here, i'm just going for a little walk.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36.0;the next morning, when a long letter came from aylmer, from spain, edith read it at breakfast and bruce didn't ask a single question.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;37.0;he was not devoted to her in the way that he was to edith, for whom he had the wholehearted enthusiasm of a loyal friend, and the idolising worship of a fanatic admirer.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;40.0;he walked a little way, then got into a taxi and drove to see edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;40.0;when he was in this peculiar condition of mind--the odd mixture of self-reproach, satisfaction, amusement and boredom that he felt now --he always went to see edith, throwing himself into the little affairs of her life as if he had nothing else on his mind.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;40.0;he was a little anxious about edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;41.0;edith watched, intensely amused, as she saw that there were really one or two people present who, never having seen mitchell before, naturally did not recognise him now, so that the disguise was considered a triumph.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;41.0;said mrs mitchell to edith, as she watched her husband proudly.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;41.0;'yes, i wish he were,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;42.0;but i have very much the same feeling,' edith said.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;42.0;when he went out his heart began to sink a little already, but he fought it off, there would be a glimpse of an english face flashing past in a carriage--he thought of edith, but he put it aside.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;45.0;perhaps till edith met aylmer she had not quite realised what such real comradeship might mean, coupled with another feeling--not the intellectual sympathy she had for vincy, but something quite different.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47.0;miss townsend said she would do whatever edith liked.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47.0;this was a relief, for just at this moment edith felt as if even the children would be a burden.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47.0;she was dressed rather like herself, edith observed, she imitated edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47.0;she was slim and had a pretty figure, but was entirely without edith's charm or beauty.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47.0;vaguely edith wondered if she would ever have a love affair, ever marry.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47.0;it was a glorious day, very hot, edith felt peculiar.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;48.0;edith was not interested in herself, and seldom thought much of her own feelings, but she hated self-deception, and now she faced facts.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;48.0;edith belonged to the superior class of human being whom jealousy chills and cures, and does not stimulate to further efforts.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;48.0;he had been in love when they married, but edith shrewdly suspected he was not capable of very much more than a weak rather fatuous sentiment for any woman.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;he was laughing as he talked to the miserable creature,so edith called her in her own mind,.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;then edith had a reaction.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;some way off was a girl, with her back to edith, walking with a man.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;her figure was like miss townsend's, and she wore a dress like the one copied from edith's.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;edith walked more quickly, it was the retired part of the gardens on the way towards the bayswater road.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;edith was surprised, was interested, and walked on a few steps.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;there was something familiar in his figure and clothes, and edith saw his face.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;edith turned round and went home.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;and now edith read aylmer's note--it was so real, so sincere, she began to disbelieve her eyes this morning.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;'how are you, edith, old girl?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;'dinner's ready,' announced edith, and they dined.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;towards the end of dinner he was about to make the suggestion again, when edith said in clear, calm but decided tones,'bruce, i am not going to take miss townsend away with us.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49.0;'bruce,' answered edith, 'i prefer not to go into the question, and later you will be glad i did not.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50.0;'oh, all right, edith dear, after all--hang it all--you're the children's mother--it's for you to settle....
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50.0;after ten minutes he came in and said,'look here, edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50.0;'edith, old girl, i think i'll go round to the club for an hour or two.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50.0;'whatever you do, edith, will be--what i mean to say is that--well, good night, i sha'n't be long.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50.0;edith was really delighted, she felt she had won, and she did want that horrid little townsend to be scored off!
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50.0;you're prettier than ever, edith, sweeter than ever.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50.0;i was struck dumb, and rooted to the spot, and knocked all of a heap, in a manner of speaking, as vincy would say,' edith went on, laughing.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;51.0;he's never told me actually, but i've felt it,' edith said.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;51.0;'i hope he won't, unless he really wants to,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;51.0;do you care for me a little bit, edith?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;51.0;'she won't come back any more,' answered edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52.0;'remember, there are to be no more exceptions,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52.0;and as she had been treated absolutely as a confidante by edith, the girl had certainly shown herself treacherous, and rather too clearly capable of dissimulation.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52.0;edith thought this must have a bad effect on the children.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52.0;edith was essentially a very feminine woman though she had a mental attitude rightly held to be more characteristic of men.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52.0;miss townsend knew perfectly well what the children were to edith, and, for all she knew, there was no-one in edith's life except bruce, so that it was rather cruel.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52.0;edith intended to keep up her dignity so absolutely that miss townsend could never see her again, that she could never speak to edith on the subject.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52.0;on the other hand, after the first shock and disgust at seeing him, edith's anger with bruce himself had entirely passed.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52.0;he was just as good a sort now as he had ever been, and as she was not blinded by the resentment and fury of the real jealousy of passion, edith saw clearly, and knew that bruce cared far more for her than for anybody else, that in so far as he could love anybody he loved her in his way.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53.0;'edith!'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53.0;'oh yes,' said edith.
brick;Thunbergia mysorensis;organism;PG10021;53.0;'edith, you're a brick.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53.0;'edith, you're a brick.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53.0;'i know it's a very odd thing to ask,' continued edith, 'just a fancy, why should i mind your not seeing miss townsend?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53.0;edith thought one might be unfaithful without being disloyal, and she believed bruce now.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53.0;'then you're not cross, edith--not depressed?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53.0;'edith!'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53.0;'don't you forgive me, edith, for anything i've done that you don't like?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;54.0;edith was really the only woman for whom his weak and flickering passion had lingered at all long, and in addition to that,the first glamour of which had faded,she had a real hold over him.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;54.0;he was not incapable, either, of appreciating edith's attitude.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;54.0;edith was wonderful!
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;54.0;edith was the only woman for whom even a little affection could last, and he would have long tired of her but for her exceptional character and the extraordinary trouble and tact she used with him.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;55.0;with the curious blindness common to all married people,and indeed to any people who live together,, clever edith had been entirely taken in, in a certain sense, she had always felt,until the 'townsend case',half disdainfully but satisfactorily certain of bruce's fidelity.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;55.0;edith always felt that she must go to the very extreme of loyalty to anyone who was faithful to her, she valued fidelity so deeply, and now this feeling was naturally relaxed a little.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;55.0;he thought edith very attractive, and would have liked to have the duty of consoling her.
hazel;Corylus;organism;PG10021;55.0;i should call them hazel, with black lashes, no, not exactly black--brown.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;55.0;edith was devoting herself to the children, bruce had less of her society than usual.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;55.0;one day he told edith that he had just had a rather serious quarrel with someone who was awfully cross, and carried on like anything and wouldn't give over.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;56.0;oh, but, edith, it's hard to hurt anyone.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;56.0;'edith,' he said,' have you asked aylmer to come and stay with us at westgate?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;56.0;you're inconsistent, edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;57.0;i'll tell edith you'll write for rooms.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;57.0;edith was there.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;57.0;and edith, dear edith--she, too, must be frightfully keen on him, when one came to think about it, to forgive him so readily about margaret tow--oh, confound miss townsend.
palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10021;58.0;as soon as a visitor came in, she rose from the suspiciously clean writing-table, put down the dry pen on a spotless blotter, went and sat in a large brocaded arm-chair in front of some palms, within view of the piano, and began to talk.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10021;58.0;one, in a short blue skirt, was blowing at something, another in pink drapery,who squinted,was strumming on a lyre, other figures were in white, with their mouths open like young birds preparing to be fed by older birds.
cat;Felis;organism;PG10021;58.0;there were other attempts at the classical in the decoration of the room, but lady everard herself had reduced this idea to bathos by huge quantities of signed photographs in silver frames, by large waste-paper baskets, lined with blue satin and trimmed with pink rosettes, by fans which were pockets, stuffed cats which were paperweights, oranges which were pincushions, and other debris from those charitable and social bazaars of which she was a constant patroness.
banjo;Aspredo aspredo;organism;PG10021;58.0;it isn't good form, it really isn't, to see a man of his age, with his face blacked, coming in after dinner with a banjo, calling himself the musical white-eyed kaffir, as he did the last time i was there.
rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10021;58.0;i was saying so to lord rye only last night.
rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10021;58.0;lord rye likes it, i think, but he says mr mitchell's mad--that's what it is, a little mad.
rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10021;58.0;last time lord rye was there everybody had a present given them hidden in their table napkins.
rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10021;58.0;there had been some mistake in the parcels, i believe, and miss mooney--you know, the actress, myra mooney--received a safety razor, and lord rye a vanity bag.
coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10021;60.0;however, have a little more tea, or some iced coffee, it's so much more refreshing i always think.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;61.0;he continued in this strain for some time, constantly going back to his admiration for edith, and then began,with a good deal of bitterness,on the subject of another young singer, whom he declared to be un garcon charmant , but no good.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;62.0;he saw edith as much as ever, and far less formally than before.
flicker;Colaptes;organism;PG10021;62.0;london was getting stale and tired, and the last feverish flickers of the exhausted season alternated with a kind of languor in which nobody bothered much about anybody else's affairs.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;62.0;edith was curiously peaceful and contented.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;62.0;'miss townsend was very kind to you,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;62.0;'very kind of her, i'm sure,' laughed edith.
dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10021;63.0;i throw myself on the parcel just like a dog, and shake it and shake it, and then i untie it with my teeth.
dog;Canidae;organism;PG10021;63.0;i throw myself on the parcel just like a dog, and shake it and shake it, and then i untie it with my teeth.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63.0;'oh, they're sure to do,' said edith, 'they're perfect.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63.0;edith asked, without much interest.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63.0;'no, you mean, 'one of us',' corrected edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63.0;'it looks lovely,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63.0;here edith showed more interest.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63.0;edith introduced them.
cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10021;63.0;i'll tell you what you ought to have--a great cricket match when the shopping season's over, between the old selfridgians, and the old harrodians,' he said, laughing.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63.0;'i can't imagine anyone but royalty enjoying these pictures,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63.0;edith and bruce were to take up their abode in their little country house at westgate next day.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;64.0;bruce had been to town so often lately, his manner was so vague, he seemed at once so happy and so preoccupied, so excited, so pleased, so worried, and yet so unnaturally good-tempered, that edith had begun to suspect he was seeing miss townsend again.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;64.0;'are you getting suspicious of me, edith?
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;65.0;'now go, edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;65.0;'i say--' edith.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;65.0;privately, edith thought him irresistible in country clothes.,edith had everything here to make her happy, including bruce's mother, who relieved her of the children when she wanted rest and in whose eyes she was perfection.
duck;Anatidae;organism;PG10021;65.0;chapter xxvi goggles 'what divine heavenly pets and ducks of angels they are!'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;65.0;lady everard with her party,what aylmer called her performing troupe,had driven over to westgate, from where she was staying in the neighbourhood, to have tea with edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;66.0;'never mind what you are, do go and sit down, and take those things off,' said edith.
mandrill;Mandrillus sphinx;organism;PG10021;66.0;well, i'm a blue-faced mandrill!'
mandrill;Mandrillus sphinx;organism;PG10021;66.0;i never said anything about being a two-faced mangle, i'm a blue-faced mandrill.'
mandrill;Mandrillus sphinx;organism;PG10021;66.0;'a blue-faced mandrill, silly, is real, it's in my natural history book.'
mandrill;Mandrillus sphinx;organism;PG10021;66.0;i'm a blue-faced mandrill....
mandrill;Mandrillus sphinx;organism;PG10021;66.0;following him, he handed the tea to mr cricker, saying pathetically,'i'm a blue-faced mandrill, and she knew it.
mandrill;Mandrillus sphinx;organism;PG10021;67.0;'a blue-faced mandrill,' she whined.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67.0;chapter xxvii the elopement the following tuesday, edith, aylmer, vincy and mrs ottley were sitting on the veranda after dinner.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67.0;she looked up to him, in a kind of admiring maternal way, edith often wondered, did she not see aylmer's devotion?
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67.0;'isn't bruce coming down tonight?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67.0;she asked edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67.0;edith went into the drawing-room to read it, there was not sufficient light on the veranda....
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67.0;in growing amazement she read the following words,-- dear edith, 'i hope what i am about to tell you will not worry you too much.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67.0;mind you do this, edith, for it is really my duty to give my name to mavis, who, as i have said, is devoted to me heart and soul, and cannot live without me.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68.0;controlling herself, edith went to the veranda and said to mrs ottley that bruce wasn't coming back for a day or two, that she had neuralgia and was going to retire, but begged aylmer not to go yet.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68.0;the next morning aylmer at his hotel received a little note asking him to come round and see edith, while the others were out.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68.0;it was there, in the cool, shady room, that edith showed him the letter.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68.0;edith, don't you see he wants you to make him free?
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68.0;edith knew she was going to have a hard task now.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68.0;the children--' 'edith!'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68.0;'edith, you don't care for me.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68.0;but, of course, if, later--i mean if he persists--' 'oh, edith, don't be a fool!
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;69.0;said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;69.0;'edith, you're beyond me,' said aylmer.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;69.0;you have no pride, edith.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;69.0;'forgive me, edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70.0;'edith ottley.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70.0;chapter xxviii bruce returns 'never, edith!'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70.0;the little group at westgate didn't seem to have much been affected by it, and this was the less surprising as aylmer and edith had kept it to themselves.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70.0;mrs ottley listened imperturbably to edith's story, a somewhat incoherent concoction, but told with dash and decision, that bruce had been ordered away for a sea-voyage for fear of a nervous breakdown.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70.0;she cried a little, said nothing, kissed edith more than usual, and took the children away for longer walks and drives.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70.0;her confidence in edith reached the point of superstition, she would never ask her questions.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70.0;edith had assured her that bruce would come back all right, and that was enough.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;probably there was at the back of his attentions to mrs ottley a vague idea that he wanted to get her on his side--that she might be a useful ally, but he was always charming to elderly women, and inclined to be brusque with younger ones, excepting edith, he remembered his own mother with so great a cult of devotion, and his late wife with such a depressed indifference.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;edith had asked aylmer to try and forget what had happened--to make himself believe that bruce had really only gone away medicinally.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;one day vincy, alone on the beach with edith, remarked that he wondered what had happened to mavis.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;edith told him that she had run away with a married man.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;'never, edith!'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;'but you're not serious, edith?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;gormed, edith dear, is really the only word.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;'i'm not jealous,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;'well--oh, you know--' 'edith, i'm awfully sorry, i wish i'd married her now, then she wouldn't have bothered about bruce.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;'i know, edith dear, but i'd marry any number of people to prevent anything tiresome for you.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;and aylmer, of course--edith, really, i think aylmer ought to go away, i'm sure he ought.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71.0;and then i should be glad i hadn't married mavis... oh, do let it be like the fourth act, edith.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;'edith, do you think if bruce knew--how much you liked aylmer--he would have written that letter?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;'i say, edith!'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;but i suppose if there's a certain predicament--then--oh, edith--are you unhappy?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;curiously, when edith had once got over the pain and shock that the letter first gave her, she was positively happier now than she ever had been before.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;'i can't see edith in anything so crude as the--as--that court,' vincy said.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;but edith would not agree.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;so the children played and enjoyed themselves, and sometimes asked after their father, and mrs ottley, though a little anxious, enjoyed herself too, and edith had never been so happy.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;the next letter in answer to edith's would doubtless convince her, and he would then persuade her, it was, tacitly, he thought, almost agreed now, it was not spoken of between them, but he believed it was all right....
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;'i think edith wants to speak to you,' she said, as she left the room.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;'dear edith!
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72.0;edith came in, in a dark dress, looking pale, and different, he thought.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;73.0;oh, edith, how could you torture me like this all the summer?'
cat;Felis;organism;PG10021;73.0;do you think i'm such a miserable fool--do you think i could endure the position of a tame cat?
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;73.0;but i suppose you must carry out your own nature, edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74.0;'i can't,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74.0;chapter xxix intellectual sympathy 'what are you going to wear tonight, edith?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74.0;'edith.'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74.0;and--edith!'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74.0;speak to her about it, will you, edith?'
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74.0;i have always made a point of letting you do exactly as you like about the children, haven't i, edith?
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74.0;'oh, she's only five, quite a baby,' said edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74.0;since his return, edith had never once referred to bruce's sea-voyage.

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;9.0;it had been customary every term for the birchites to play a match against them either at cricket or football, but their conduct during a visit paid to the ground of the latter, back in the previous summer, had been so very ungentlemanly and unsportsmanlike that, when the next challenge arrived for an encounter at football, mr. welsby wrote back a polite note expressing regret that he did not see his way clear to permit a continuation of the matches.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;14.0;the company shouted themselves hoarse, for every one felt that the honour of the birches had been retrieved, and that the day was still far distant when they would be crushed beneath the iron heel of young noaks, or be exposed as an unresisting prey to the ravages of the wild hordes of horace house.
birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;14.0;as this story is to be a history of the triple alliance, and not of the birches, it will be necessary to pass over many things which happened at the preparatory school, in order that full justice may be done to the important parts played by our three friends in an epoch of strange and stirring events at ronleigh college.

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;20.0;the records of their big scores at cricket, or their victories at football, which appeared in local papers, were always read with admiration, and the name of an old birchite appearing in either of the teams was a thing of which every one felt justly proud.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;25.0;it seemed altogether beyond their power to do anything, and yet there was not a boy who would not have given his dearest possession, were it a white rat or a stamp collection, if by parting with it he could have rendered some assistance to his ill-fated comrade.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10027;26.0;to imagine the disappointment of the philistines when they discovered that the bird had flown, and the chagrin of young noaks when he found that his play-box padlock was fastened to the door of the shed, was simply delightful, and acton was so carried away that he once more fell on diggory's neck, and pretended to shed tears of joy upon the latter's broad turn-down collar.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;26.0;it was an annual custom at the birches for the boys to subscribe towards getting a display of fireworks, which were let off in the playground under the superintendence of mr. blake.

plum;Prunus domestica;organism;PG10027;27.0;the two boys found miss eleanor making cake, and the conference began by diggory's having his ears boxed for picking plums out of the dough.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;27.0;miss eleanor had a dread of gunpowder, and mr. blake sent jack vance to tell noaks to carry the box as usual down into the shed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;27.0;diggory trotted off to fetch the flag, and jack vance, who was loitering about one of the passages, accompanied him down into the playground.

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;30.0;the old feud died out, giving place to a far better spirit, which was manifested each term in the friendly manner in which the teams met for matches at cricket and football.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;30.0;"but though, after the fame they had won at the birches, it was rather humiliating at first to find themselves regarded as three nobodies, yet there was some compensation in the thought that, just as the smallest drummer-boy can point to a flag covered with ""honours,"" and say"

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;31.0;they passed once more through the double doors, and were crossing the quadrangle, when a certain incident attracted their notice, unimportant in itself, but indicating a strong contrast in the manner of life at ronleigh to what they had always been accustomed to at the birches.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;31.0;"""why, i thought it was only masters did that,"" said jack vance."
birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;31.0;it was very different from the cosy little bedrooms at the birches, but the three friends were glad to be allowed to undress in peace and quiet, and had scrambled safely into bed some time before the prefect put in an appearance to turn out the light.
birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;32.0;there was plenty to engage their attention, and much that was new and singular after their comparatively quiet playground at the birches.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;32.0;jack vance, diggory, and mugford sat together at the first desk, just in front of the master's table, and were soon busy in proving their previous acquaintance with the latin grammar.

cucumber;Cucumis sativus;organism;PG10027;32.0;young noaks, however, walked up cool as a cucumber, and holding out his hand said,--

animal;Animalia;organism;PG10027;33.0;they certainly were an amusing lot of little animals, and diggory and his companions coming into the classroom rather late, and before the entrance of the master, saw them for the first time to full advantage.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;34.0;down in the box-room, a good-sized apartment boarded off from the gymnasium, jack vance was serving out a ration of plum-cake to a select party, consisting of his two chums and carton, when the ex-philistine strolled up and joined himself to the group.
sheep;Ovis aries;organism;PG10027;34.0;noaks certainly seemed to have discovered a chum in the black sheep of the upper fourth, and the triple alliance began to congratulate themselves that he would trouble them no further.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;37.0;it is probable that, if this had happened at horace house, jack vance would have received a good licking as soon as the classes were dismissed, but a few very plain and forcible words spoken by rowlands on the subject of knocking small boys about caused noaks to postpone his retaliation.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;32.0;a clever girl like edith morriston, more sensitive than to a casual observer would appear, had naturally recognized this danger and was anxious to have the man, with his, perhaps, none too scrupulous methods, held in check, and to this service gifford was only too happy to devote himself, glad beyond measure that the opportunity had been given him by the girl who had filled his thoughts.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;33.0;he presently took an opportunity of joining edith morriston in the garden.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;34.0;one thing, however, gifford did not like, and that was henshaw's rather obvious admiration for edith morriston.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;34.0;he wondered whether in the absence of any other apparent cause, edith morriston's attractiveness had had anything to do with it.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10029;35.0;it had, in view of gifford's commission from miss morriston, been arranged that he should share kelson's rooms at the golden lion , no longer as a guest, so that both men were now independent of each other.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;36.0;he strolled out one afternoon, aimlessly, wondering whether the negative result of his efforts justified his remaining in the place, and yet loath to leave it, held there as he was by the attraction of edith morriston.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;36.0;it was, in its unexpectedness, an almost appalling sight to him, as he realised that the two were none other than henshaw and edith morriston.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;36.0;henshaw and edith morriston!
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10029;36.0;he stooped, and creeping warily beyond the fringe of trees looked after the pair.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;36.0;there could be no doubt that the lady was edith morriston, and the man?
grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10029;36.0;they had stopped now, at the end of the ride, the man talking earnestly, it seemed, miss morriston standing with head bent down and scoring the grass with her walking-stick as though in doubt or consideration.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;37.0;he hated the idea of spying upon edith morriston, after all, if she chose to walk and talk with this man it was no business of his, but a supreme distrust of henshaw, unreasonable enough, perhaps, but none the less keen, made him suspicious that the man might be playing some cowardly game, might have drawn the girl to him by unfair means.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10029;37.0;he could catch but a glimpse of them through the intervening trees as they went by slowly, but it was enough to tell him that henshaw was talking earnestly, arguing, it seemed, and on edith morriston's clear-cut face was a look of trouble which was not good to see.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;37.0;henshaw had been caught and fascinated by edith morriston's beauty, and being, as was obvious, a man of energy and determination, was now in some subtle way making use of the tragedy as a means of forcing his unwelcome attentions on her.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;37.0;of course the man was waiting either to waylay edith morriston or to meet her by appointment.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;37.0;that henshaw's object was more or less disreputable could not be doubted, and to gifford the amazing and troubling part of it was that edith morriston, the very last woman he would have suspected of consenting to such a course, who had professed an absolute dislike and repugnance to henshaw, and fear of his annoying presence, should be meeting him thus willingly.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;38.0;that this unpleasantly sharp, pushing product of the less dignified side of the law could have any personal attraction for one of edith morriston's taste and discrimination was impossible.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;38.0;was it possible that this man could have found out something connecting edith morriston with his brother's death?
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;38.0;"""well,"" kelson answered, ""it appears that edith morriston's maid found them some days ago, in fact the day after a similar discovery had been made on muriel's gown."
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;39.0;"i wonder whether edith morriston has any idea as to how her dress got marked."""
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;39.0;and he was now making use of it to put the screw on, using the hold he had gained over edith morriston to bend her to his will.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;39.0;thinking out the situation strenuously gifford determined to seek a private interview with edith morriston and offer himself as her protector.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;39.0;anyhow in consideration of the trust edith morriston had shown in him he would seek an interview with her and chance what it might bring forth.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;40.0;nevertheless he determined to go and do his best to get a private talk with edith morriston, however disinclined she might be to grant it.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;40.0;edith morriston seemed as friendly and gracious as ever, but whether by accident or design she gave no chance for gifford to get in a private word.
snowdrop;Galanthus nivalis;organism;PG10029;40.0;the three went round to the stables and inspected the hunters, then through the shrubbery to admire a wonderful bed of snowdrops.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;41.0;"""i say, edith, what do you think?"""
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;41.0;but his expression changed as he glanced at edith morriston, she had denied that she had been in the room.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42.0;anyhow it is a source of congratulation to miss tredworth and you, edith.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42.0;morriston said cheerfully.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42.0;involuntarily gifford had glanced at edith morriston.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42.0;"""let's hope to announce that at last they are going to leave you in peace, edith,"" miss tredworth said."
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42.0;edith morriston did not alter her position as she stood looking out of the window.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42.0;"you too, edith, and miss tredworth, there is nothing at all horrible in it so far."""
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42.0;for the first time edith morriston turned from the window.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42.0;gifford was the last to leave the room, and his glance back showed him that edith morriston had turned again to the window and resumed her former attitude.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;44.0;edith morriston was no longer there.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;45.0;"""i am waiting for edith,"" she said."
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;45.0;"""we'll stroll on and gifford can bring miss morriston after us,"" kelson suggested, and the lovers moved away, leaving gifford, much to his satisfaction, waiting for edith morriston."
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;45.0;edith morriston was thinking strenuously, desperately, he could see that.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;47.0;edith morriston's eyes were fixed with something like fear on an object behind him.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;47.0;chapter xix in the churchyard nothing more of importance happened that day at wynford, and gifford had no further opportunity of private talk with edith morriston.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;47.0;that he was intimidating her, and using his brother's death for that purpose, was beyond doubt, and the very fact that edith morriston was a woman of uncommon courage and self-control, one who in ordinary circumstances would be the last to give way to fear or submit to bullying, showed how serious the matter had become.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;47.0;and a significant circumstance which came to gifford's knowledge a day or two after his interview with edith morriston in the garden of wynford, was the cause of his beginning to take action without further delay.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10029;48.0;a horse and trap was waiting there with henshaw in it.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10029;48.0;henshaw the londoner, on a sunday evening, waiting with a horse and trap in an unfrequented lane, a road which ran nowhere but to a farm.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;48.0;naturally gifford's suspicions connected edith morriston with the circumstance, and yet he told himself the idea was monstrously improbable.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;48.0;it did seem absurd to imagine that henshaw with his conveyance could be waiting there by appointment for a girl of the character and position of edith morriston.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;48.0;his heart gave a leap, for although the woman's face and figure were indistinguishable the height and gait corresponded with those of edith morriston.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;49.0;chapter xx an involuntary eavesdropper as she heard the words edith morriston stood for a moment as though transfixed, and then staggered back grasping at a tombstone for support.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;50.0;it was good to see the eager relief in edith morriston's eyes.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;50.0;"""yes, i remember he arrived quite early,"" edith morriston murmured."
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;51.0;there was a catch of growing excitement in edith morriston's voice, which was scarcely above a whisper.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;51.0;edith morriston glanced quickly at gifford as he uttered the reflection.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;52.0;edith morriston interrupted him to ask.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;53.0;they had stopped in their walk now, and edith morriston was listening almost breathlessly to gifford's graphic story.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;54.0;edith morriston drew a great breath of relief from the painful tension with which she had listened.
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;55.0;"""to suspect me,"" edith morriston completed his sentence with a smile."

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;56.0;edith morriston looked at him steadily.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;57.0;"""dick has driven into branchester,"" edith morriston said, perhaps to end an embarrassing pause."
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;57.0;"""the story i have to tell you, mr. gifford,"" edith morriston began, ""is not a pleasant one and is as humiliating to me to relate as was the experience, the terrible experience, i had to go through."

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;60.0;"""it was unspeakably sad,"" edith morriston continued, ""but it seemed like fate, seeing how things rearranged themselves afterwards."
edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;61.0;edith morriston gave a little shudder.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;63.0;chapter xxv defiance for some moments henshaw did not speak, indeed, it was probable that the unexpected success of his search for edith morriston--for such doubtless was his object--had so disagreeably startled him, that he was unable to pull those sharp wits of his together at once.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;65.0;coming from edith morriston's champion, there was nothing surprising in that assertion.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;68.0;his light heart must have been reflected in his face, for edith morriston's anxious look brightened as she joined him in the drawing-room.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10050;30.0;and now she found herself at a distance from the great city, which shone in the light with its beautiful towers, and roofs, and all its monuments, softly fringed with trees, and set in a heavenly firmament.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10050;30.0;the path lay along the bank of the river which flowed beside her and made the air full of music, and a soft air blew across the running stream and breathed in her face and refreshed her, and the birds sang in all the trees.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10050;30.0;and she perceived that the village folk were a simple folk, not learned and wise like those she had left, and that though they lived within sight of the great city, and showed every stranger the beautiful view of it, and the glory of its towers, yet few among them had travelled there, for they were so content with their fields, and their river, and the shade of their trees, and the birds singing, and their simple life, that they wanted no change, though it pleased them to receive the little pilgrim, and they brought her into their villages rejoicing, and called every one to see her.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10050;31.0;and they told her how the lord himself would come among them, and sit down under a tree, and tell them one of his parables, and make them all more happy than words could say, and how sometimes he would send one out of the beautiful city, with a poem or tale to say to them, and bands of lovely music, more lovely than anything beside, except the sound of the lord's own voice.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10050;32.0;they sat down by the roadside under the shade of the trees,--while the river ran softly by, and everything was hushed out of sympathy and kindness,--and questioned each other of all that had been and was to be.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;1.0;one fair morning while she turned over these thoughts in her mind there suddenly came towards her one whom she knew as a sage, of the number of those who know many mysteries and search into the deep things of the father.
plant;Plantae;organism;PG10051;2.0;it was narrow and rough, and the skies were dim, and as she went on by the side of her guide she saw houses and gardens which were to her like the houses that children build, and the little gardens in which they sow seeds and plant flowers, and take them up again to see if they are growing.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;2.0;she turned to the sage, saying, 'what are--?'
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;2.0;'if anything comes into your heart to do or say, it will be well for them,' the sage replied,and he took her by the hand and led her into a house she knew.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;3.0;and the sage who was her companion soothed her with kind words.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;3.0;the sage only shook his head at her, smiling.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;4.0;said the sage, and when she listened she heard the sound of the children going back with a great murmur and ringing of pleasant voices like silver bells in the air, and among them the voice of the child asking a thousand questions, calling them by their names.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;4.0;the sage said in her ear.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;5.0;as she came forth again comforted, she found the sage standing with his face lifted to heaven, smiling still at the sound, though faint and distant, of the children all calling to each other and shouting together as they reached the gate.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;6.0;the sage made her a sign to follow, and these two tender companions accompanied her who saw them not, walking darkling by the silent way.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;6.0;'it is the secret of the lord,' said the sage, but not even they had seen him passing by.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;7.0;'at his own time,' said the sage, 'and in his own way.'
brier;Erica arborea;organism;PG10051;7.0;though she was herself among the blessed, yet the thorns and briers of the earth caught at her garments and pierced her tender feet.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;8.0;'little sister,' said the sage, 'to us who are born of the earth it is hard to remember that the child belongs not first to the parents, nor the husband to the wife, nor the wife to the husband, but that all are the children of the father.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;8.0;'he will come when all things are ready,' said the sage, and as they went upon their way be showed her other sights, and the mysteries of the heart of man, and the great patience of our lord.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10051;8.0;the air was fresh with the dew, and the birds awaking in the trees, and the breeze so sweet that it seemed to blow from heaven, and to the two travellers it seemed almost in the joy of the new day as if the lord had already come.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;9.0;the air seemed in a moment to be full of the sound of footsteps, and of something more subtle, which the sage and the pilgrim knew to be wings, and as they looked, there grew before them the semblance of a court of justice, with accusers and defenders, but the judge and the criminal were one.
old wife;Enoplosus armatus;organism;PG10051;9.0;but then there came a clang and clamor of sound on the other side, and voices called out to him as comrade, as lover, as friend, and reminded him of the delights which once had been so sweet to him, and of the freedom he loved, and boasted the right of man to seek what was pleasant and what was sweet, and flouted him as a coward whose aim was to save himself, and scorned him as a believer in old wives' tales and superstitions that men had outgrown.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;9.0;she put her hand upon the arm of the sage and called to him, 'speak you, speak you!
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;9.0;the sage led the little pilgrim forth in a great confusion, so that she could not speak for wonder.
sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;10.0;the sage spoke softly, as if with awe.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10051;18.0;he lay there, half in the light and half in the shadow, gripping the rocks with his hands, burrowing into the cool herbage above and the mountain flowers, clinging, catching hold, despairing, yet seizing everything he could grasp,--the tender grass, the rolling stones.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10051;19.0;he lay silent while they watched and waited, then turned himself upon the grass, which was as soft to the weary wayfarer as angels' wings, and then the sunshine caught his eye, as if he had been a newborn babe awakened to the light.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10051;19.0;he put out his hand to it, and touched the ground that was golden with those heavenly rays, and gathered himself up till he felt it upon his face, and opened wide his dazzled eyes, then shaded them with trembling hands, and said to himself, 'it is the sun, it is the sun!'
ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10051;20.0;for when the eyes are used to the darkness, the horror of the gloom was no longer like a solid thing, but moved into shades of darker and less dark, so that she saw where the rocks stood, and how they sank with edges that cut like swords down and ever down into the abysses, and how here a deep ravine was rent between them, and there were breaks and scars as though some one had caught the jagged points with wounded hand or foot, struggling up the perpendicular surface towards the little ray of light, like a tiny star which shone as on immeasurable heights to show where life was.
ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10051;20.0;as she travelled deeper and deeper, it was a wonder to see how far that little ray penetrated down and down through gulfs of darkness, blue and cold like the shimmer of a diamond, and even when it could be seen no more, sent yet a shadowy refraction, a line of something less black than the darkness, a lightening amid the gloom, a something indefinable which was hope.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10051;22.0;it had taken less than a moment to sweep him past, quicker than the flight of a bird, as sudden as a lightning flash.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10051;24.0;and all her being thrilled like a bird with its song, so that the very air stirred, yet no voice came.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10051;32.0;here and there seemed a cluster of giant trees scathed as if by lightning, their bare boughs standing up as high as the distant towers, their trunks like black columns without foliage.
ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10051;34.0;i might have flung myself upon a bed of hot ashes, so much was it unlike the dewy cool earth which i expected, upon which one can always throw one's self with a sensation of repose.
ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10051;36.0;he struggled up from the ground, clearing his hot eyes from the ashes that were in them, and putting aside his singed hair.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG10051;36.0;you've got to go the round like the rest,' he said with a laugh which was like a sound uttered by a wild animal rather than a human voice.
miner;Geositta;organism;PG10051;37.0;it was not fire, it was the lurid glow of the gold, glowing like flame, at which countless miners were working.
fly;Diptera;organism;PG10051;37.0;they were all about like flies,--some on their knees, some bent double as they stooped over their work, some lying cramped upon shelves and ledges.

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10051;37.0;i had strength enough, however,for i cared not for the gold,, to fling myself back the other way upon the ground, where i rolled backwards, downwards, i knew not how, turning over and over upon sharp ashes and metallic edges, which tore my hair and beard.
ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10051;37.0;i had sense to lie still among the ashes thrown up out of the pit, while i heard their voices.
ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10051;37.0;the glitter of a lantern flashed in my eyes, a foot passed, crashing among the ashes so close to my cheek that the shoe grazed it.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10052;1.0;the village of brentwood lay almost under the house, on the other side of the deep little ravine, down which a stream--which ought to have been a lovely, wild, and frolicsome little river--flowed between its rocks and trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10052;1.0;our side of the dell was charmingly accidente , and clothed with fine trees, through which various paths wound down to the river-side and to the village bridge which crossed the stream.
ivy;Hedera helix;organism;PG10052;2.0;the old building had the remains of a tower,--an indistinguishable mass of mason-work, over-grown with ivy, and the shells of walls attached to this were half filled up with soil.
bramble;Rubus plicatus;organism;PG10052;2.0;there was a large room, or what had been a large room, with the lower part of the windows still existing, on the principal floor, and underneath other windows, which were perfect, though half filled up with fallen soil, and waving with a wild growth of brambles and chance growths of all kinds.
rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG10052;2.0;no offices remained to be entered,--pantry and kitchen had all been swept out of being, but there stood the door-way open and vacant, free to all the winds, to the rabbits, and every wild creature.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10052;3.0;the horses seemed to me to creep along the long dark country road.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10052;3.0;as we dashed through the park, i thought i heard some one moaning among the trees, and clenched my fist at him,whoever he might be,with fury.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10052;3.0;the horses flew like lightning along the intervening path, and drew up at the door all panting, as if they had run a race.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10052;4.0;and i replied, when i could find my voice, also in a whisper, as though the jingling of the horses' furniture and the sound of their hoofs must not have been more dangerous.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10052;4.0;i stood on the steps with her a moment, almost afraid to go in, now that i was here, and it seemed to me that i saw without observing, if i may say so, that the horses were unwilling to turn round, though their stables lay that way, or that the men were unwilling.

holly;Ilex;organism;PG10052;12.0;on one side was the bowling-green, which the girls had taken possession of for their croquet-ground,--a wonderful enclosure surrounded by high hedges of holly, three hundred years old and more, on the other, the ruins.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;16.0;dr. simson did nothing but utter subdued laughs under his breath.

holly;Ilex;organism;PG10052;17.0;all that coming and going of the voice was, if our ears could be trusted, exactly in front of the vacant, blank door-way, blazing full of light, which caught and shone in the glistening leaves of the great hollies at a little distance.

drill;Mandrillus leucophaeus;organism;PG10062;22.0;battalion and brigade drill, too, were new diversions for the caribees, as now, camped near other troops, these more complicated movements were part of the regiment's allotted duty.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23.0;one day jack and barney, walking in fifteenth street, saw a stout man, with no insignia to indicate rank or station, coming out of the headquarters hurriedly.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23.0;noticing the two lads, he came to where jack was standing in a preoccupied way, and the two saluted decorously.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23.0;he gave jack an envelope and hurried back into the building as the two lads started with alacrity across the street.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23.0;the war department was easy of access, an old building not unlike jack's own home in acredale.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23.0;the man looked at it, pointed to a closed door, and jack, receiving no response to his knock, entered.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23.0;but the figure that fixed jack's reverential attention was half sprawling, half lying over the heaped-up impediments of the big desk.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23.0;without a word jack handed him the envelope, and with a sort of reverence to the tall figure whose face was turned kindly toward him he backed to the door.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23.0;but jack's good fortune was the talk of the regiment for many a day, and for months when the fellows of the caribee got leave they lingered expectantly about the modest headquarters, hoping that a missing orderly might bring them jack sprague's proud distinction of seeing the president face to face.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;23.0;on the grand review, a few days later, jack and his crony were reminded of the encounter at headquarters, for the man who had given the envelope to carry to the war office was riding a splendid horse next to the president.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27.0;appalled by jack's stern manner as much as by his words, the two lads began to whimper and expostulate tearfully.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27.0;jack was deeply perplexed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27.0;jack's relief and gratitude were best seen in the brightening eye and the more buoyant movement that succeeded the heaviness and agitation of his first impression.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27.0;jack explained something of this to the young marlboroughs, and was fairly irritated at the crest-fallen look that came into their eager, shining faces when they comprehended that they were not to be with their hero.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;28.0;the very possibility of being sent into some unknown regiment was a terror so great that the other alternative became less odious to the boys, and they trotted after jack, as he stalked moody and distracted to major mike mcgoyle's tent, now the only habitable spot left where a few hours before a symmetrical little city had stood.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;28.0;it was impossible for jack to sustain the role of frowning displeasure as dick skipped back with him to the company.
jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;28.0;jack, through colonel grandison, knew that general mcdowell and the commander-in-chief, the venerable soldier scott, had pleaded and protested against a move until the new levies under the three-months' call could be drilled and disciplined.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;42.0;but jack is easy on the score of his mission, since the general, who is nearest the stone bridge, has been apprised, and well knows that the fire which has been coming near his left flank is sherman's.

and relative;Vespertilioninae;organism;PG10377;47.0;the few scattered friends and relatives, whose sympathies had been moved by the melancholy fate of poor mrs. marston, were unanimously agreed that the intended removal of the young and innocent daughter to the polluted mansion of sin and shame, was too intolerably revolting to be permitted.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10377;48.0;the pretty garden, near the well, among the lime trees, that our darling mother was so fond of, is all but obliterated with weeds and grass, and since my first visit i have not had heart to go near it again.
lime;Tilia;organism;PG10377;48.0;the pretty garden, near the well, among the lime trees, that our darling mother was so fond of, is all but obliterated with weeds and grass, and since my first visit i have not had heart to go near it again.
grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10377;48.0;the pretty garden, near the well, among the lime trees, that our darling mother was so fond of, is all but obliterated with weeds and grass, and since my first visit i have not had heart to go near it again.
grass;Poaceae;organism;PG10377;48.0;the pretty garden, near the well, among the lime trees, that our darling mother was so fond of, is all but obliterated with weeds and grass, and since my first visit i have not had heart to go near it again.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10377;51.0;as, leaning upon the arm of her astonished attendant, she retracted her steps, the trees, the flowers, the familiar hall-door, the echoing passages--every object that met her eye--seemed strange and unsubstantial, and she gliding on among them in a horrid dream.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10377;55.0;doctor parkes, whose bedroom was next to that occupied by marston, was awakened in the dead of night by a howling, more like that of a beast than a human voice, and which gradually swelled into an absolute yell, then came some horrid laughter and entreaties, thick and frantic, then again the same unearthly howl.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;1.0;here and there it appeared to be covered with clumps of queer vegetation, though whether they were small trees or great bushes, i had no means of telling, but this i know, that they were like unto nothing which ever i had set eyes upon before.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10542;1.0;here and there it appeared to be covered with clumps of queer vegetation, though whether they were small trees or great bushes, i had no means of telling, but this i know, that they were like unto nothing which ever i had set eyes upon before.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;1.0;thus i found that it was indeed composed largely of a sort of tree, very low and stunted, and having what might be described as an unwholesome look about it.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;1.0;the branches of this tree, i perceived to be the cause of my inability to recognize it from a bush, until i had come close upon it, for they grew thin and smooth through all their length, and hung towards the earth, being weighted thereto by a single, large cabbage-like plant which seemed to sprout from the extreme tip of each.

plant;Plantae;organism;PG10542;1.0;the branches of this tree, i perceived to be the cause of my inability to recognize it from a bush, until i had come close upon it, for they grew thin and smooth through all their length, and hung towards the earth, being weighted thereto by a single, large cabbage-like plant which seemed to sprout from the extreme tip of each.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;1.0;it may be, all unconsciously, that my spirit was put in awe by the extreme silence of all the country around, for in all that waste i could see no living thing, neither bird nor vegetable, save it be the stunted trees, which, indeed, grew in clumps here and there over all the land, so much as i could see.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10542;1.0;it may be, all unconsciously, that my spirit was put in awe by the extreme silence of all the country around, for in all that waste i could see no living thing, neither bird nor vegetable, save it be the stunted trees, which, indeed, grew in clumps here and there over all the land, so much as i could see.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10542;1.0;nothing moved across my vision--not even a lone bird soared up against the dull sky, and, for my hearing, not so much as the cry of a sea-bird came to me--no!
frog;Anura;organism;PG10542;2.0;nor the croak of a frog, nor the plash of a fish.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;2.0;then, a little before sundown, we halted upon our oars, and made a scant meal from a portion of our remaining provisions, and as we ate, i could see the sun sinking away over the wastes, and i had some slight diversion in watching the grotesque shadows which it cast from the trees into the water upon our larboard side, for we had come to a pause opposite a clump of the vegetation.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;3.0;now as i sat listening, george gripped me suddenly by the arm, declaring in a shrill whisper that something had come among the clump of trees upon the left-hand bank.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10542;3.0;of the truth of this, i had immediately a proof, for i caught the sound of a continuous rustling among them, and then a nearer note of growling, as though a wild beast purred at my elbow.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;3.0;and so the hours passed, and naught happened more than i have told, save that once, a little after midnight, the trees opposite to us seemed to be stirred again, as though some creature, or creatures, lurked among them, and there came, a little after that, a sound as of something stirring the water up against the bank, but it ceased in a while and the silence fell once more.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;4.0;the strange vessel lay against that bank of the creek which was upon our right, and over above her was a thick clump of the stunted trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;4.0;and so he sung out again to her, chance there might be some below decks who had not caught his first hail, but, for the second time, no answer came to us, save the low echo--naught, but that the silent trees took on a little quivering, as though his voice had shaken them.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10542;5.0;when we had come into the captain's cabin, we closed and barred the door, piling two great sea chests up against it, and so we felt near safe, for we knew that no thing, man nor beast, could come at us there.
bat;Chiroptera;organism;PG10542;6.0;for it was neither shuffling, nor treading of any kind, nor yet was it the whirr of a bat's wings, the which had first occurred to me, knowing how vampires are said to inhabit the nights in dismal places.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10542;6.0;nor yet was it the slurr of a snake, but rather it seemed to us to be as though a great wet cloth were being rubbed everywhere across the floor and bulkheads.
corn;Zea mays;organism;PG10542;7.0;the box had appeared filled with odd small lumber of which a part was a dozen or so grey paper wrappers, such as are used, i believe, for carrying samples of corn, though i have seen them put to other purposes, as, indeed, was now the case.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;7.0;"""now, when they discovered the spring among the trees that crown the bank, there was much rejoicing, for we had come to have much need of water."
sheep;Ovis aries;organism;PG10542;9.0;and as we remained thus, an instant, like silly sheep awaiting the butcher, i heard the framework creak and crack, and there ran splits all across the glass.
teak;Tectona;organism;PG10542;9.0;in a little, it died away, and in the brief silence that seemed to ensue, we heard a slobby fumbling at the teak cover, but it was well secured, and we had no immediate cause for fear.
teak;Tectona;organism;PG10542;9.0;and, odd whiles, there was a soft thudding and rubbing upon the decks over our heads, and once, as i recollect, the thing made a final try at the teak covers across the windows, but the day came at last, and found me sleeping.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;9.0;in a little, we came to breakfast, and, after that, we prepared to test the story upon the sample wrappers and see perchance whether there was indeed a spring of fresh water among the trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;9.0;now between the vessel and the trees, lay a slope of the thick mud, against which the vessel rested.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;10.0;here, we entered at once among the trees, for they grew right up to the edge, but we had no trouble in making a way, for they were nowhere close together, but standing, rather, each one in a little open space by itself.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;10.0;we had gone a little way among the trees, when, suddenly, one who was with us cried out that he could see something away on our right, and we clutched everyone his weapon the more determinedly, and went towards it.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;10.0;i saw his back as he passed into the wood, and ran until i was up with him, for, suddenly, as it were, i found that a sense of chilly dampness had come among the trees, though a while before the place had been full of the warmth of the sun.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;once he called, and again, then at the second shout we heard the boy's shrill halloo, from some distance ahead among the trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;but the lad, for reply, pointed with my sword, and we saw that he pointed at what appeared to be a bird against the trunk of one of the trees.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10542;11.0;but the lad, for reply, pointed with my sword, and we saw that he pointed at what appeared to be a bird against the trunk of one of the trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;this, as i moved closer, i perceived to be a part of the tree, and no bird, but it had a very wondrous likeness to a bird, so much so that i went up to it, to see if my eyes had deceived me.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10542;11.0;this, as i moved closer, i perceived to be a part of the tree, and no bird, but it had a very wondrous likeness to a bird, so much so that i went up to it, to see if my eyes had deceived me.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;with a sudden thought that it would make me a curio, i reached up to see whether i could break it away from the tree, but it was above my reach, so that i had to leave it.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;yet, one thing i discovered, for, in stretching towards the protuberance, i had placed a hand upon the tree, and its trunk was soft as pulp under my fingers, much after the fashion of a mushroom.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;as we turned to go, the bo'sun inquired of george his reason for going beyond the spring, and george told him that he had seemed to hear someone calling to him among the trees, and there had been so much pain in the voice that he had run towards it, but been unable to discover the owner.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;immediately afterwards he had seen the curious, bird-like excrescence upon a tree nearby.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;we had come nigh to the spring on our return journey, when a sudden low whine seemed to run among the trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;at that, george and i turned ourselves about to perceive what matter it was which had attracted the attention of the bo'sun, thus we made out a tree some twenty yards away, which had all its branches wrapped about its trunk, much as the lash of a whip is wound about its stock.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;yet, when we had come close upon it, we had no means of arriving at a knowledge of that which it portended, but walked each of us around the tree, and were more astonished, after our circumnavigation of the great vegetable than before.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;now, suddenly, and in the distance, i caught the far wailing that came before the night, and abruptly, as it seemed to me, the tree wailed at us.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;at that i was vastly astonished and frightened, yet, though i retreated, i could not withdraw my gaze from the tree, but scanned it the more intently, and, suddenly, i saw a brown, human face peering at us from between the wrapped branches.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;then, before i had possession of myself, i saw that it was of a part with the trunk of the tree, for i could not tell where it ended and the tree began.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;then i caught the bo'sun by the arm, and pointed, for whether it was a part of the tree or not, it was a work of the devil, but the bo'sun, on seeing it, ran straightway so close to the tree that he might have touched it with his hand, and i found myself beside him.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;11.0;now, george, who was on the bo'sun's other side, whispered that there was another face, not unlike to a woman's, and, indeed, so soon as i perceived it, i saw that the tree had a second excrescence, most strangely after the face of a woman.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;12.0;then, far away, i heard again the sound of the wailing and, immediately, from among the trees about us, there came answering wails and a great sighing.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;12.0;and before i had time to be more than aware of these things, the tree wailed again at us.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;12.0;and, immediately, he began with his cutlass to strike at the tree before us, and to cry upon god to blast it, and lo!
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;12.0;at his smiting a very fearsome thing happened, for the tree did bleed like any live creature.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;12.0;and, suddenly, i became aware that all about us the trees were a-quiver.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;12.0;now from the brig i heard them hallooing, and the trees had become like live things, and there was a vast growling in the air, and hideous trumpetings.
flicker;Colaptes;organism;PG10542;12.0;as we went i looked back at the brig, and it seemed to me that a multitude of things hung over the bank above her, and there seemed a flicker of things moving hither and thither aboard of her.
gunnel;Pholis gunnellus;organism;PG10542;13.0;with this intent, we roused out so much heavy canvas as the boats contained, for we had gotten a bolt and a half from the hulk in the creek, also the boat covers which we could lash down to the brass studs under the gunnels of the boats.
gunnel;Pholis gunnellus;organism;PG10542;13.0;then we laid two lengths of the stout canvas the full length of the boat over the whaleback, overlapping and nailing them to the same, so that they sloped away down over the gunnels upon each side as though they had formed a roof to us.
hemp;Cannabis sativa;organism;PG10542;13.0;here, whilst some stretched the canvas, nailing its lower edges to the gunnels, others were employed in lashing together the oars and the mast, and to this bundle they secured a considerable length of new three-and-a-half-inch hemp rope, which we had brought away from the hulk along with the canvas.
gunnel;Pholis gunnellus;organism;PG10542;13.0;here, whilst some stretched the canvas, nailing its lower edges to the gunnels, others were employed in lashing together the oars and the mast, and to this bundle they secured a considerable length of new three-and-a-half-inch hemp rope, which we had brought away from the hulk along with the canvas.
gunnel;Pholis gunnellus;organism;PG10542;13.0;now by this time we had the canvas nailed down to the gunnels around our boat, after which we spread the boat-cover over it, lacing it down to the brass studs beneath the gunnel.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10542;13.0;a little before evening, the moaning came again, and then a space of silence, after which there rose a very sudden bellowing, as of wild beasts, and then once more the silence.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10542;14.0;it was as though some mighty beast growled far down towards the south, and it seemed to make very clear to me that we were but two small craft in a very lonesome place.
gunnel;Pholis gunnellus;organism;PG10542;14.0;then, the bo'sun whipped in his oar under the cover, and, reaching forward, drew the canvas aft, so that it covered the entire boat, and he held it down against the gunnel upon the starboard side, shouting in my ear to do likewise upon the larboard.
gunnel;Pholis gunnellus;organism;PG10542;14.0;and so for the space of maybe a full minute the boat quivered and shook most vilely, so that she seemed like to have been shaken in pieces, and from a dozen places between the gunnel and the covering canvas, the water spurted in upon us.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;17.0;and beyond this, i could make out but little, because of the distance, though the sun, which was upon our larboard side, gave me some sight of her hull, but not much, because of the weed in which she was deeply embedded, yet it seemed to me that her sides were very weather-worn, and in one place some glistening brown object, which may have been a fungus, caught the rays of the sun, sending off a wet sheen.
ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10542;17.0;and beyond this, i could make out but little, because of the distance, though the sun, which was upon our larboard side, gave me some sight of her hull, but not much, because of the weed in which she was deeply embedded, yet it seemed to me that her sides were very weather-worn, and in one place some glistening brown object, which may have been a fungus, caught the rays of the sun, sending off a wet sheen.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;17.0;and now we saw that it was full of crabs, though for the most part so very minute as to escape the casual glance, yet they were not all small, for in a while i discovered a swaying among the weed, a little way in from the edge, and immediately i saw the mandible of a very great crab stir amid the weed.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;17.0;then he made a running bowline, and slipped the loop on to the shaft of the boat hook, after which he held out the boat hook, after the fashion of a fishing rod, over the place where i had seen the crab.
claw;Amniota;body;PG10542;17.0;almost immediately, there swept up an enormous claw, and grasped the meat, and at that, the bo'sun cried out to me to take an oar and slide the bowline along the boat-hook, so that it should fall over the claw, and this i did, and immediately some of us hauled upon the line, taughtening it about the great claw.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;17.0;then the bo'sun sung out to us to haul the crab aboard, that we had it most securely, yet on the instant we had reason to wish that we had been less successful, for the creature, feeling the tug of our pull upon it, tossed the weed in all directions, and thus we had full sight of it, and discovered it to be so great a crab as is scarce conceivable--a very monster.
gunnel;Pholis gunnellus;organism;PG10542;18.0;from the time that i relieved the bo'sun, until midnight, i sat upon the gunnel of the boat, with the steering oar under my arm, and watched and listened, most full of a sense of the strangeness of the seas into which we had come.
rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10542;18.0;her side was streaked in places with rust, and in others a green scum overspread her, but it was no more than a glance that i gave at any of those matters, for i had spied something which drew all my attention--great leathery arms splayed all across her side, some of them crooked inboard over the rail, and then, low down, seen just above the weed, the huge, brown, glistening bulk of so great a monster as ever i had conceived.
rust;Pucciniales;organism;PG10542;18.0;her side was streaked in places with rust, and in others a green scum overspread her, but it was no more than a glance that i gave at any of those matters, for i had spied something which drew all my attention--great leathery arms splayed all across her side, some of them crooked inboard over the rail, and then, low down, seen just above the weed, the huge, brown, glistening bulk of so great a monster as ever i had conceived.
devilfish;Mobula mobular;organism;PG10542;18.0;the bo'sun saw it in the same instant and cried out in a hoarse whisper that it was a mighty devilfish, and then, even as he spoke, two of the arms flickered up into the cold light of the dawn, as though the creature had been asleep, and we had waked it.
rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10542;19.0;but what took our eyes more than aught else was a great superstructure which had been built upward from her rails, almost half-way to her main tops, and this, as we were able to perceive, was supported by ropes let down from the yards, but of what material the superstructure was composed, i have no knowledge, for it was so over-grown with some form of green stuff--as was so much of the hull as showed above the weed--as to defy our guesses.
devilfish;Mobula mobular;organism;PG10542;19.0;it seemed to be no more than a hundred fathoms distant, and, against the moon, i saw the outline of it most clearly--a mighty devilfish.
rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10542;19.0;i swayed upon the oar to turn the boat's head outward, and with the same movement leant forward and sideways to peer, bringing my face near to the boat's rail.
beak;Bilateria;body;PG10542;19.0;in the same instant, i found myself looking down into a white demoniac face, human save that the mouth and nose had greatly the appearance of a beak.
beak;Libythea;organism;PG10542;19.0;in the same instant, i found myself looking down into a white demoniac face, human save that the mouth and nose had greatly the appearance of a beak.
bamboo;Bambuseae;organism;PG10542;20.0;in this valley there seemed to be a deal of a strange vegetation that had the appearance of mighty toadstools, and down nearer the beach there was a thick grove of a kind of very tall reed, and these we discovered afterwards to be exceeding tough and light, having something of the qualities of the bamboo.
bamboo;Bambusoideae;organism;PG10542;20.0;in this valley there seemed to be a deal of a strange vegetation that had the appearance of mighty toadstools, and down nearer the beach there was a thick grove of a kind of very tall reed, and these we discovered afterwards to be exceeding tough and light, having something of the qualities of the bamboo.
bamboo;Bambuseae;organism;PG10542;21.0;for the reeds were very strong, and hollow after the fashion of bamboo, and when he had bound some yarn about the end into which he had thrust his knife, so as to prevent it splitting, it was a fit enough weapon for any man.

fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;21.0;and now, he, in turn, called my attention to the place where the huge fungi had come to a stop in their growing, and i saw that in the center of the valley there was a great circular opening in the earth, like to the mouth of a prodigious pit, and it appeared to be filled to within a few feet of the mouth with water, over which spread a brown and horrid scum.
gunnel;Pholis gunnellus;organism;PG10542;22.0;fortunately for him he was no more than some thirty yards from the shore at this time, else he had never come to it in this life, for the next moment the moving brown mass beneath the boat shot out a great tentacle and the oar was torn out of job's hands with such power as to throw him right over on to the starboard gunnel of the boat.
cuttlefish;Sepia;organism;PG10542;23.0;now, at sight of the devil-fish, we had all made for the back of the beach at a run, none troubling even to retain the painter, and because of this, we were like to have lost the boat, for the great cuttlefish had its arms all splayed about it, seeming to have a mind to drag it down into the deep water from whence it had risen, and it had possibly succeeded, but that the bo'sun brought us all to our senses, for, having laid job out of harm's way, he was the first to seize the painter, which lay trailed upon the sand, and, at that, we got back our courage and ran to assist him.
devilfish;Mobula mobular;organism;PG10542;23.0;with these, it was possible to attack the devilfish without coming within reach of its tentacles.
cuttlefish;Sepia;organism;PG10542;23.0;yet it mattered not, for the wound inflicted by the bo'sun's weapon was so frightful, that the giant cuttlefish released the boat, and slid back into deep water, churning it into foam, and gouting blood.
hemp;Cannabis sativa;organism;PG10542;25.0;and afterwards, we carried all the loose woodwork of the boat into the tent, emptying the lockers of their contents, which included some oakum, a small boat's hatchet, a coil of one-and-a-half-inch hemp line, a good saw, an empty colza-oil tin, a bag of copper nails, some bolts and washers, two fishing-lines, three spare tholes, a three-pronged grain without the shaft, two balls of spun yarn, three hanks of roping-twine, a piece of canvas with four roping-needles stuck in it, the boat's lamp, a spare plug, and a roll of light duck for making boat's sails.
duck;Anatidae;organism;PG10542;25.0;and afterwards, we carried all the loose woodwork of the boat into the tent, emptying the lockers of their contents, which included some oakum, a small boat's hatchet, a coil of one-and-a-half-inch hemp line, a good saw, an empty colza-oil tin, a bag of copper nails, some bolts and washers, two fishing-lines, three spare tholes, a three-pronged grain without the shaft, two balls of spun yarn, three hanks of roping-twine, a piece of canvas with four roping-needles stuck in it, the boat's lamp, a spare plug, and a roll of light duck for making boat's sails.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;25.0;at that i tried mightily to turn and look into the shadows among the great fungi that stood all about me, but i had no power to turn.
mosquito;Culicidae;organism;PG10542;26.0;i put up my hand and felt my face, and the hand when i brought it away was slippery with slime, and at that, i put up my other hand, and touched my throat, and there it was the same, only, in addition, there was a slight swelled place a little to one side of the wind-pipe, the sort of place that the bite of a mosquito will make, but i had no thought to blame any mosquito.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10542;28.0;yet, before we did aught else, the bo'sun led us all into the valley, being determined to make a very thorough exploration of it, perchance there might be any lurking beast or devil-thing waiting to rush out and destroy us as we worked, and more, he would make search that he might discover what manner of creatures had disturbed our night.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;28.0;now in the early morning, when we had gone for the fuel, we had kept to the upper skirt of the valley where the rock of the nearer hill came down into the spongy ground, but now we struck right down into the middle part of the vale, making a way amid the mighty fungi to the pit-like opening that filled the bottom of the valley.
plant;Plantae;organism;PG10542;28.0;apart from the markings which i have mentioned, there was everywhere a deal of slime, and this we traced all over the valley among the great toadstool plants, but, beyond that which i have already remarked, we found nothing.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10542;28.0;nay, but i was near to forgetting, we found a quantity of this thin slime upon those fungi which filled the end of the little valley nearest to our encampment, and here also we discovered many of them fresh broken or uprooted, and there was the same mark of the beast upon them all, and now i remember the dull thuds that i had heard in the night, and made little doubt but that the creatures had climbed the great toadstools so that they might spy us out, and it may be that many climbed upon one, so that their weight broke the fungi, or uprooted them.

hemp;Cannabis sativa;organism;PG10542;29.0;all the lower and topmast standing rigging was still attached, though in places the lower rigging was stranded so far as half-way up the shrouds, yet there remained much that was good and all of it quite free from rot, and of the very finest quality of white hemp, such as is to be seen only in the best found vessels.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;29.0;at this moment, the man the bo'sun had sent to gather shellfish, returned, and he had a great crab upon his spear, which he had spitted through the belly.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;30.0;by this time it was quite dusk, and very strange amid the great fungi as we struck across the upper edge of the valley to the opposite beach.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;30.0;we had gotten halfway across the top of the valley, and the gloom was deepening steadily, when there stole to me upon the calmness of the evening air, a faint smell, something quite different from that of the surrounding fungi.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;30.0;and at that, some of the men made to run, but he bade them, in a very grim voice, stay where they were, and keep well together, else would they be attacked and overcome, straggled all among the fungi in the dark.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;30.0;when the fires had been got going, we put on the boiler, and treated the great crab as i have already mentioned, and so fell-to upon a very hearty supper, but, as we ate, each man had his weapon stuck in the sand beside him, for we had knowledge that the valley held some devilish thing, or maybe many, though the knowing did not spoil our appetites.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;31.0;he plucked his torch from the ground, into which he had plunged the haft, and stared round into the silence of the valley, but there was no living thing in sight, nothing save the giant fungi and the strange shadows cast by our great torches, and the loneliness.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;31.0;now whether it had come to the bo'sun to set alight this first of the fungi, i know not, for it may be that his torch coming by chance against it, set it afire.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;31.0;yet, that we were so suddenly overcome by the potency of the powder, i doubt if a full minute passed before we were each one busied after the manner of the bo'sun, and those whose torches had burned out, knocked flaming pieces from the burning fungus, and with these impaled upon their torch-sticks, did so much execution as any.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;32.0;and during all that night no man of us slept, and the burning of the fungi sent up a mighty pillar of flame out of the valley, as out of the mouth of a monstrous pit and when the morning came it still burned.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;34.0;upon reaching the further beach, we saw a most incredible sight, for the two men were running towards us through the thick masses of the weed, while, no more than four or five fathoms behind, they were pursued by an enormous crab.
claw;Amniota;body;PG10542;34.0;now i had thought the crab we had tried to capture before coming to the island, a prodigy unsurpassed, but this creature was more than treble its size, seeming as though a prodigious table were a-chase of them, and moreover, spite of its monstrous bulk, it made better way over the weed than i should have conceived to be possible--running almost sideways, and with one enormous claw raised near a dozen feet into the air.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;34.0;now i had thought the crab we had tried to capture before coming to the island, a prodigy unsurpassed, but this creature was more than treble its size, seeming as though a prodigious table were a-chase of them, and moreover, spite of its monstrous bulk, it made better way over the weed than i should have conceived to be possible--running almost sideways, and with one enormous claw raised near a dozen feet into the air.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;34.0;upon receiving this thrust, the mighty crab ceased at once its pursuit, and clipped at the haft of the spear with its great mandible, snapping the weapon more easily than i had done the same thing to a straw.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;34.0;by the time we had raced up to the men, the one who had stumbled was again upon his feet, and turning to assist his comrade, but the bo'sun snatched his spear from him, and leapt forward himself, for the crab was making now at the other man.
claw;Amniota;body;PG10542;34.0;now the bo'sun did not attempt to thrust the spear into the monster, but instead he made two swift blows at the great protruding eyes, and in a moment the creature had curled itself up, helpless, save that the huge claw waved about aimlessly.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;34.0;at that, the bo'sun drew us off, though the man who had attacked the crab desired to make an end of it, averring that we should get some very good eating out of it, but to this the bo'sun would not listen, telling him that it was yet capable of very deadly mischief, did any but come within reach of its prodigious mandible.
gunnel;Pholis gunnellus;organism;PG10542;34.0;it was a little before the evening came down upon the island, that the bo'sun ceased work, and, after that, he called to the men, who, having made an end of their fuel carrying, were standing near, to place the full breakers--which we had not thought needful to carry to the new camp on account of their weight--under the upturned boat, some holding up the gunnel whilst the others pushed them under.
cuttlefish;Sepia;organism;PG10542;35.0;now, as i have said, it was not unlike a great king-fish, and like it, had a mouth full of very formidable teeth, the use of which i understood the better when i saw the contents of its stomach, which seemed to consist of nothing but the coiled tentacles of squid or cuttlefish, with which, as i have shown, the weed-continent swarmed.
squid;Teuthida;organism;PG10542;35.0;now, as i have said, it was not unlike a great king-fish, and like it, had a mouth full of very formidable teeth, the use of which i understood the better when i saw the contents of its stomach, which seemed to consist of nothing but the coiled tentacles of squid or cuttlefish, with which, as i have shown, the weed-continent swarmed.
bunting;Emberiza;organism;PG10542;36.0;more than this, it was scarce credible that they should not have made an answering fire, or set some of their bunting above the superstructure, so that our gaze should be arrested upon the instant we chanced to glance towards the hulk.

bamboo;Bambuseae;organism;PG10542;39.0;now it seemed to me a possible thing to substitute a bow for the mortar, if only we could find the material with which to make such a weapon, and with this in view, i took up one of the lengths of the bamboo-like reed, and tried the spring of it, which i found to be very good, for this curious growth, of which i have spoken hitherto as a reed, had no resemblance to that plant, beyond its appearance, it being extraordinarily tough and woody, and having considerably more nature than a bamboo.
plant;Plantae;organism;PG10542;39.0;now it seemed to me a possible thing to substitute a bow for the mortar, if only we could find the material with which to make such a weapon, and with this in view, i took up one of the lengths of the bamboo-like reed, and tried the spring of it, which i found to be very good, for this curious growth, of which i have spoken hitherto as a reed, had no resemblance to that plant, beyond its appearance, it being extraordinarily tough and woody, and having considerably more nature than a bamboo.
bamboo;Bambusoideae;organism;PG10542;39.0;now it seemed to me a possible thing to substitute a bow for the mortar, if only we could find the material with which to make such a weapon, and with this in view, i took up one of the lengths of the bamboo-like reed, and tried the spring of it, which i found to be very good, for this curious growth, of which i have spoken hitherto as a reed, had no resemblance to that plant, beyond its appearance, it being extraordinarily tough and woody, and having considerably more nature than a bamboo.
plant;Plantae;organism;PG10542;39.0;then i looked about until i came upon a very young and slender reed which had been cut with the rest, and from this i fashioned some sort of an arrow, feathering it with a piece of one of the broad, stiff leaves, which grew upon the plant, and after that i went forth to the crowd about the leeward edge of the hill.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;39.0;but the bo'sun shook his head, and reminded them of the great devil-fish and crabs, and the worse things which the weed concealed, saying that those in the ship would have done it long since had it been possible, and at that the men were silenced, being robbed of their unreasoning ardor by his warnings.
hemp;Cannabis sativa;organism;PG10542;41.0;presently, it occurred to me that i should do well to set some of the men to work upon the line which the arrow was to carry, for i had determined that this should be made also from the white hemp yarns, and, for the sake of lightness, i conceived that one thickness of yarn would be sufficient, but so that it might compass enough of strength, i bid them split the yarns and lay the two halves up together, and in this manner they made me a very light and sound line, though it must not be supposed that it was finished at once, for i needed over half a mile of it, and thus it was later finished than the bow itself.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;42.0;thus, the moon being very bright, and the desolation of the valley reasonably clear to the eye, it appeared to me, as i looked that i saw a movement among certain of the fungi which had not burnt, but stood up shriveled and blackened in the valley.
porpoise;Phocoenidae;organism;PG10542;43.0;as i saw it, it seemed to me that a number of great fish were swimming across from the island, diagonally towards the great continent of weed,they were swimming in one wake, and keeping a very regular line, but not breaking the water after the manner of porpoises or black fish.
flicker;Colaptes;organism;PG10542;43.0;yet, though i have mentioned this, it must not be supposed that i saw any very strange thing in such a sight, and indeed, i thought nothing more of it than to wonder what sort of fish they might be, for, as i saw them indistinctly in the moonlight, they made a queer appearance, seeming each of them to be possessed of two tails, and further, i could have thought i perceived a flicker as of tentacles just beneath the surface, but of this i was by no means sure.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;45.0;then, when they had come fully at it, the one who had proposed that they should make spears of their knives, cried out to know why a kite would not do, and at that i was confounded, in that so simple an expedient had not occurred to any before, for, surely, it would be but a little matter to float a line to them by means of a kite, and, further, such a thing would take no great making.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;45.0;and so, after a space of talk, it was decided that upon the morrow we should build some sort of kite, and with it fly a line over the hulk, the which should be a task of no great difficulty with so good a breeze as we had continually with us.
fungus;Fungi;organism;PG10542;45.0;xiii the weed men now, on that night, when i came to my watch, i discovered that there was no moon, and, save for such light as the fire threw, the hill-top was in darkness, yet this was no great matter to trouble me, for we had been unmolested since the burning of the fungi in the valley, and thus i had lost much of the haunting fear which had beset me upon the death of job.
flicker;Colaptes;organism;PG10542;47.0;and now i was made to understand my thought of the previous night, that i had seen the flicker of tentacles, for these things below us had each two short and stumpy arms, but the ends appeared divided into hateful and wriggling masses of small tentacles, which slid hither and thither as the creatures moved about the bottom of the valley, and at their hinder ends, where they should have grown feet, there seemed other flickering bunches, but it must not be supposed that we saw these things clearly.
parrot;Psittaciformes;organism;PG10542;47.0;at that, i could have screamed, had i been in less terror, for the great eyes, so big as crown pieces, the bill like to an inverted parrot's, and the slug-like undulating of its white and slimy body, bred in me the dumbness of one mortally stricken.
beak;Bilateria;body;PG10542;49.0;at this, i dodged, and ran madly towards the glowing mound of the nearest fire, the brutes following me almost so quick as i could run, but i came to the fire the first, and then, a sudden thought coming to me, i thrust the point of my cut-and-thrust among the embers and switched a great shower of them at the creatures, and at that i had a momentary clear vision of many white, hideous faces stretched out towards me, and brown, champing mandibles which had the upper beak shutting into the lower, and the clumped, wriggling tentacles were all a-flutter.
beak;Libythea;organism;PG10542;49.0;at this, i dodged, and ran madly towards the glowing mound of the nearest fire, the brutes following me almost so quick as i could run, but i came to the fire the first, and then, a sudden thought coming to me, i thrust the point of my cut-and-thrust among the embers and switched a great shower of them at the creatures, and at that i had a momentary clear vision of many white, hideous faces stretched out towards me, and brown, champing mandibles which had the upper beak shutting into the lower, and the clumped, wriggling tentacles were all a-flutter.
duck;Anatidae;organism;PG10542;51.0;now, however, the bo'sun set-to upon them, washing and binding them up, and for dressings he made use of some of the oakum which we had with us, binding this on with strips torn from the roll of spare duck, which had been in the locker of the boat.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;51.0;then he bade the man, jessop by name, who had proposed to fly a kite over the vessel in the weed, to say whether he had any craft in the making of such a matter.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;51.0;at that, the fellow laughed, and told the bo'sun that he would make him a kite that would fly very steadily and strongly, and this without the aid of a tail.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;51.0;now hearing the man say that his kite would fly without a tail, i was mightily curious to see what manner of thing he would make, for i had never seen the like, nor heard that such was possible.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;52.0;now, when he had gotten so far as that, the bo'sun called out to us to make our dinners, and this we did, and afterwards had a short time in which to smoke, and whilst we were thus at our ease the sun came out, the which it had not done all the day, and at that we felt vastly brighter, for the day had been very gloomy with clouds until that time, and what with the loss of tompkins, and our own fears and hurts, we had been exceeding doleful, but now, as i have said, we became more cheerful, and went very alertly to the finishing of the kite.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;52.0;at this point it came suddenly to the bo'sun that we had made no provision of cord for the flying of the kite, and he called out to the man to know what strength the kite would require, at which jessop answered him that maybe ten-yarn sennit would do, and this being so, the bo'sun led three of us down to the wrecked mast upon the further beach, and from this we stripped all that was left of the shrouds, and carried them to the top of the hill, and so, presently, having unlaid them, we set-to upon the sennit, using ten yarns, but plaiting two as one, by which means we progressed with more speed than if we had taken them singly.
duck;Anatidae;organism;PG10542;52.0;now, as we worked, i glanced occasionally towards jessop, and saw that he stitched a band of the light duck around each end of the framework which he had made, and these bands i judged to be about four feet wide, in this wise leaving an open space between the two, so that now the thing looked something like to a punchinello show, only that the opening was in the wrong place, and there was too much of it.
hemp;Cannabis sativa;organism;PG10542;52.0;after that he bent on a bridle to two of the uprights, making this of a piece of good hemp rope which he found in the tent, and then he called out to the bo'sun that the kite was finished.

hemp;Cannabis sativa;organism;PG10542;52.0;now, i think that jessop gathered something of our thoughts, for, calling to one of us to hold the kite, lest it should blow away, he went into the tent, and brought out the remainder of the hemp line, the same from which he had cut the bridle.

kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;52.0;this, he bent on to it, and, giving the end into our hands, bade us go back with it until all the slack was taken up, he, in the meanwhile, steadying the kite.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10542;52.0;then, when we had gone back to the extent of the line, he shouted to us to take a very particular hold upon it, and then, stooping, caught the kite by the bottom, and threw it into the air, whereupon, to our amazement, having swooped somewhat to one side, it steadied and mounted upwards into the sky like a very bird.

kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;52.0;and now, being well assured of the properness of the kite, the bo'sun bade us to draw it in, the which we did only with difficulty, because of its bigness and the strength of the breeze.
hemp;Cannabis sativa;organism;PG10542;53.0;presently, as a result of some little thought, he brought out from the tent the long piece of hemp rope with which we had moored the boat to the sea anchor, and proceeded to unlay it, until he had all three strands separate.
hemp;Cannabis sativa;organism;PG10542;53.0;thus it will be seen that counting all, including the piece of hemp line from which the bridle had been made, we may be said to have had at this time about four hundred fathoms towards the length which we needed for our purpose, this having been reckoned at five hundred fathoms.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;53.0;now when the morning came we were all of us very eager to come to the flying of the kite, for it seemed possible to us that we might effect the rescue of the people in the hulk before the evening.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;53.0;and, at the thought of this, we experienced a very pleasurable sense of excitement, yet, before the bo'sun would let us touch the kite, he insisted that we should gather our usual supply of fuel, the which order, though full of wisdom, irked us exceedingly, because of our eagerness to set about the rescue.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;53.0;yet, before setting the kite off, the bo'sun took us down to the further beach to bring up the foot of the royal and t'gallant mast, which remained fast to the topmast, and when we had this upon the hill-top, he set its ends upon two rocks, after which he piled a heap of great pieces around them, leaving the middle part clear.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;53.0;round this he passed the kite line a couple or three times, and then gave the end to jessop to bend on to the bridle of the kite, and so he had all ready for paying out to the wreck.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;53.0;and now, having nothing to do, we gathered round to watch, and, immediately, the bo'sun giving the signal, jessop cast the kite into the air, and, the wind catching it, lifted it strongly and well, so that the bo'sun could scarce pay out fast enough.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;54.0;now, before the kite had been let go, jessop had bent to the forward end of it a great length of the spun yarn, so that those in the wreck could catch it as it trailed over them, and, being eager to witness whether they would secure it without trouble, we ran all of us to the edge of the hill to watch.
kite;Milvus;organism;PG10542;54.0;thus, within five minutes from the time of the loosing of the kite, we saw the people in the ship wave to us to cease veering, and immediately afterwards the kite came swiftly downwards, by which we knew that they had the tripping-line, and were hauling upon it, and at that we gave out a great cheer, and afterwards we sat about and smoked, waiting until they had read our instructions, which we had written upon the covering of the kite.
hemp;Cannabis sativa;organism;PG10542;54.0;presently, maybe the half of an hour afterwards, they signaled to us to haul upon our line, which we proceeded to do without delay, and so, after a great space, we had hauled in all of our rough line, and come upon the end of theirs, which proved to be a fine piece of three-inch hemp, new and very good, yet we could not conceive that this would stand the stress necessary to lift so great a length clear of the weed, as would be needful, or ever we could hope to bring the people of the ship over it in safety.
hemp;Cannabis sativa;organism;PG10542;54.0;and so we waited some little while, and, presently, they signaled again to us to haul, which we did, and found that they had bent on a much greater rope to the bight of the three-inch hemp, having merely intended the latter for a hauling-line by which to get the heavier rope across the weed to the island.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;58.0;and so, at last, as it cleared the weed because of the lift of the cliff, we saw that a great crab had clutched it, and that we hauled it towards us, for the creature had too much obstinacy to let go.
claw;Amniota;body;PG10542;58.0;perceiving this, and fearing that the great claws of the crab might divide the rope, the bo'sun caught up one of the men's lances, and ran to the cliff edge, calling to us to pull in gently, and put no more strain upon the line than need be.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;58.0;perceiving this, and fearing that the great claws of the crab might divide the rope, the bo'sun caught up one of the men's lances, and ran to the cliff edge, calling to us to pull in gently, and put no more strain upon the line than need be.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;58.0;then the bo'sun bade us haul in the rest of the rope, until we should come to the packet, and, in the meantime, he examined the line to see whether it had suffered harm through the mandibles of the crab, yet, beyond a little chafe, it was quite sound.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10542;58.0;i had stood there awhile, watching the rope, when, suddenly, there came a commotion amid the weed, about two-thirds of the way to the ship, and now i saw that the rope had freed itself from the weed, and clutching it, were, maybe, a score of giant crabs.
oak;Quercus;organism;PG10542;67.0;yet, further than this, the bo'sun bade the carpenter make wooden caps of six inch oak, these caps to fit over the squared heads of the lower-mast stumps, and having a hole, each of them, to embrace the jury-mast, and by making these caps in two halves, they were able to bolt them on after the masts had been hove into position.
barnacle;Balanus;organism;PG10542;67.0;and so at last we came to the day on which we were in so good a condition that the bo'sun and the second mate considered the ship to be in a fit state to put to sea--the carpenter having gone over so much of her hull as he could get at and found her everywhere very sound, though her lower parts were hideously overgrown with weed, barnacles and other matters, yet this we could not help, and it was not wise to attempt to scrape her, having consideration to the creatures which we knew to abound in those waters.
rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10542;69.0;yet the ship drew clear, and so into the open water beyond the point, but i had seen something as we scraped against the weed, a sudden glimpse of white, gliding among the growth, and then i saw others, and, in a moment, i was down on the main-deck, and running aft to the bo'sun, yet midway along the deck a horrid shape came above the starboard rail, and i gave out a loud cry of warning.
rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10542;69.0;now the bo'sun had seen my stroke, and so sprang upon the t'gallant rail, and peered over, but gave back on the instant, shouting to me to run and call the other watch, for that the sea was full of the monsters swimming off to the ship, and at that i was away at a run, and when i had waked the men, i raced aft to the cabin and did likewise with the second mate, and so returned in a minute, bearing the bo'sun's cutlass, my own cut-and-thrust, and the lantern that hung always in the saloon.
rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10542;69.0;now when i had gotten back, i found all things in a mighty scurry--men running about in their shirts and drawers, some in the galley bringing fire from the stove, and others lighting a fire of dry weed to leeward of the galley, and along the starboard rail there was already a fierce fight, the men using capstan-bars, even as i had done.
rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10542;69.0;then i thrust the bo'sun's cutlass into his hand, and at that he gave a great shout, part of joy, and part of approbation, and after that he snatched the lantern from me, and had run to the larboard side of the deck, before i was well aware that he had taken the light, but now i followed him, and happy it was for all of us in the ship that he had thought to go at that moment, for the light of the lantern showed me the vile faces of three of the weed men climbing over the larboard rail, yet the bo'sun had cleft them or ever i could come near, but in a moment i was full busy, for there came nigh a dozen heads above the rail a little aft of where i was, and at that i ran at them, and did good execution, but some had been aboard, if the bo'sun had not come to my help.
rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10542;69.0;and now the decks were full of light, several fires having been lit, and the second mate having brought out fresh lanterns, and now the men had gotten their cutlasses, the which were more handy than the capstan-bars, and so the fight went forward, some having come over to our side to help us, and a very wild sight it must have seemed to any onlooker, for all about the decks burned the fires and the lanterns, and along the rails ran the men, smiting at hideous faces that rose in dozens into the wild glare of our fighting lights.
tiger;Puma concolor;organism;PG10542;69.0;and up on the poop, the fight was as brisk as elsewhere, and here, having been drawn by a cry for help, i discovered the buxom woman smiting with a gory meat-axe at a vile thing which had gotten a clump of its tentacles upon her dress, but she had dispatched it, or ever my sword could help her, and then, to my astonishment, even at that time of peril, i discovered the captain's wife, wielding a small sword, and the face of her was like to the face of a tiger, for her mouth was drawn, and showed her teeth clenched, but she uttered no word nor cry, and i doubt not but that she had some vague idea that she worked her husband's vengeance.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10542;70.0;and, after that, we talk softly of the land where god hath made monsters after the fashion of trees.
bird;Aves;organism;PG1062;1.0;then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
beast;Animalia;organism;PG1062;1.0;"much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore, for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door-- bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, with such name as ""nevermore."""

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;13.0;much, i know, had been writ concerning this odd, vast watcher, for it had grown out of the blackness of the south unknown lands a million years gone, and the steady growing nearness of it had been noted and set out at length by the men they called monstruwacans, so that it was possible to search in our libraries, and learn of the very coming of this beast in the olden-time.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;13.0;and, while i mind me, there were even then, and always, men named monstruwacans, whose duty it was to take heed of the great forces, and to watch the monsters and the beasts that beset the great pyramid, and measure and record, and have so full a knowledge of these same that, did one but sway an head in the darkness, the same matter was set down with particularness in the records.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;14.0;and, later, through hundreds and thousands of years, there grew up in the outer lands, beyond those which lay under the guard of the redoubt, mighty and lost races of terrible creatures, half men and half beast, and evil and dreadful, and these made war upon the redoubt, but were beaten off from that grim, metal mountain, with a vast slaughter.

flicker;Colaptes;organism;PG10662;26.0;and they who had been of late so joyful, were now grown old with sorrow in but an hour or two, for they feared that the fresh coming of the earth-current had been but the final flicker and outburst before the end.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10662;30.0;but some order went about among the youths, and they made a long line, with a certain space between each, because of the terror of their weapon, and immediately, it seemed, the giants were upon them, a score and seven they were, and seeming to be haired like to mighty crabs, as i saw with the great spy-glass, when the great flares of far and mighty fires threw their fierce light across the dark lands.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG10662;30.0;and there was a very great and horrid fight, for the youths broke into circles about each of the giants, and many of those young men were torn in pieces, but they smote the monsters from behind and upon every side, and we of the mighty pyramid could behold at times the grey, strange gleam of their weapons, and the jether was stirred about me by the passing of those that died, yet, by reason of the great miles, their screams came not to us, neither heard we the roars of the monsters, but into our hearts, even from that great distance and safety, there stole the terror of those awesome brutes, and in the great spy-glass i could behold the great joints and limbs and e'en, i thought, the foul sweat of them, and their size and brutishness was like to that of odd and monstrous animals of the olden world, yet part human.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10662;33.0;and i swept the great spy-glass over the land, towards the valley of the hounds, that i might discover them quickly, and i saw them come lumbering, at a strange gallop, and great as horses, and it might be only ten miles to the east.
corn;Zea mays;organism;PG10662;35.0;even as the blowing of a sorrowful wind did it come, and i knew that all the great multitudes did sing quietly, and the singing passed onwards, and left behind it an utter silence, even as the wind doth rustle the corn, and pass onwards, and all fall to a greater seeming quietness than before.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;40.0;and, at the last i grew maddened with the sorrow of this thing, and the sense and knowledge of harm about the maid, and i stood upright upon my feet, and i raised my hands, and gave word and honour unto naani through all the blackness of the night, that i would no more abide within the mighty pyramid to my safety, whilst she, that had been mine own through eternity, came to horror and destruction by the beasts and evil powers of that dark world.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;42.0;and this, also, is but a small matter, yet doth it bear upon the inwardness of my feelings, for the memories of all my youth and of the many beasts that i had seen to peer across the light, did come upwards in my mind in that moment, so that i did give back a little, unthinking of what i did, but having upon me the sudden imagining of that which might come out of the dark, beyond.
insect;Insecta;organism;PG10662;43.0;then did it come to me that those little things, which i did see to cluster against the embrasures, were in truth the countless millions of the mighty redoubt, and this i could make out with some plainness in those lower embrasures, which were the more near to me than they above, for the peoples were set against the light within, yet were as small things like unto insects, in that distance, and within so huge a bulk.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;44.0;and in the bottom there were great seas, and beasts strange and awesome, and very plentiful.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;49.0;and, swift and silent, i slid the cloak from about me, and took the haft of that wondrous diskos into mine hand.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;49.0;and the message was sharp, and bade me to leap into the bushes unto my left, and to hide there, so that i might chance to take the thing to an advantage.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;49.0;as i did crouch there, hidden, i saw something come very quiet out of the bushes that did grow beyond the fire-hole, and it was great, and crept, and was noways coloured but by greyness in all its parts.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;50.0;yet, i doubt that it saw beyond the fire with plainness, for, in a moment, it crept swift in among the bushes again, and came out towards the edge of the fire-hole in another place, and this it did thrice unto my left, and thrice unto my right, and every time did lay its head to the earth, and spy along, and did hunch its shoulders, and thrust forward the jaw horridly and turn the neck, as a very nasty beast might go, wanton.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;50.0;now, as you may think, this manner of the beast-man did shake my courage mightily, for i did think each time that it did go inward among the moss-bushes, that it had made discovery of me, and would make to take me in the back, from out of the dark of the bushes, and this was an uncomfortable thing to consider, as others might think also, had any been there in the bush with me.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;50.0;and, suddenly, i saw a little moving of a bush that grew to the back of those bushes in which i had been hid, and there came out of the bush that moved, a great grey hand, and moved the moss of the clump where i had been, as it were that something peered out of the moving bush.
moss;Bryophyta;organism;PG10662;50.0;and, suddenly, i saw a little moving of a bush that grew to the back of those bushes in which i had been hid, and there came out of the bush that moved, a great grey hand, and moved the moss of the clump where i had been, as it were that something peered out of the moving bush.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;50.0;and i knew that i must strike now, and i leapt, and smote with the diskos, and the thing fell upon its side, and the great grey legs came out of the hither bushes, and twitched and drew upwards, but the head remained in the bush where i had been hid.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;50.0;and presently the grey man was dead, and i went away from those bushes, unto the far side of the fire-hole.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;51.0;and i sat me down in a little clear place among the bushes, and did eat three of the tablets, and did once more shake forth the dust that did turn in the air to a natural water by a proper and natural chemistry of these matters.
bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10662;53.0;should he not find them to shift upon his vision, so that the great bear and this and that shaping of the star clusterings, should make a new order, as he did wander onwards, and so should he find that there was naught that was truly fixed, as he did before then think, but all to alter according unto the place whence the looking!
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;54.0;and a great time i did lie there upon my belly, and shaken by a fear of the beast, yet emboldened, as you may conceive, by having come to the side, and being hopeful in my heart that i was very secure within so great a shadow and the thick sheltering of the moss-bushes.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;54.0;and i gat an abrupt and horrid shaking of the spirit, for i did feel in verity that my soul had come too anigh, and that the beast had a sure knowledge concerning me, yet did make to my destruction with no haste, but after that way and fashion that did seem proper unto it.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;55.0;and after a longer while, i did leave that hill of watchfulness to my rear, and was gone onward into the night, yet, as may be known, with a vague unease and trouble to my heart, and a swift and frequent turning to learn surely that no evil thing came after me.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;55.0;and here you must know that the place where the silent ones kill was an utter bare place, where all did seem of rock, and no bush did seem to grow thereon, so that a man might not come to any hiding, though, in truth, there might be some hole here or there, yet was none shown in any map within the pyramid, neither did there seem to be any such to me, as i did creep there among the moss-bushes to the northward of the place, and look constant and fearful towards it, so that i should see quickly whether any silent one did move across all the grey quiet of that rocky plain.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;55.0;and so you shall conceive how that i did slide very quiet from bush unto bush, for i had alway in all my life had a very dread fear of this place, and oft did i peer out into the dim grey light of the lonesome plain unto my left, and would think sometimes to perceive the shapes of the silent ones stood vague and watchful, yet, on the instant, to see nothing.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;56.0;and i sat there among the moss-bushes, and did consider, and lookt out cunningly through a spy-hole of the bush in which i did sit.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;56.0;as i did go to rise up out of the bush, mine eyes were opened, as it were, and i saw that there was something amid the constant greyness, and i fell quickly into the bush, and did sweat very chill, but yet did haste to look.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;56.0;and there grew therefrom a little courage into mine heart, and i obeyed my spirit, and took an hold of my strength and went slowly backward in the bushes.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;56.0;and as i made to thrust forward out of the bushes, that i might look and go downward into the hollow, there rose up to me the sound of a very large voice, and deep and husky.
elephant;Elephantidae;organism;PG10662;57.0;and as i crouched there within the moss-bushes, there came again the large voice, and it was answered by a second voice, and thereupon there arose, as it did seem, the speech of men that must have the bigness of elephants, and that did have no kindness in all their thoughts, but were utter monstrous.
elephant;Proboscidea;organism;PG10662;57.0;and as i crouched there within the moss-bushes, there came again the large voice, and it was answered by a second voice, and thereupon there arose, as it did seem, the speech of men that must have the bigness of elephants, and that did have no kindness in all their thoughts, but were utter monstrous.
elephant;Elephantidae;organism;PG10662;57.0;for, after that i had made but a glance, as it were, at these sleeping and utter monstrous men, i perceived that there sat beyond the fire-hole, three great men, and they were each greater than elephants, and covered a large part with a stiff and horrid hair, that did be of a reddish seeming.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;57.0;and there was between them the body of a mighty hound, so big as an horse, that they did skin, and i judged that this beast was one of those fearsome brutes which we did call the night hounds.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10662;57.0;and there was between them the body of a mighty hound, so big as an horse, that they did skin, and i judged that this beast was one of those fearsome brutes which we did call the night hounds.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;57.0;and you shall know that this brought to me a very swift and sudden terror, for i perceived now the why of their long silence, for, in verity, they had an unease upon them, being subtly aware that one was anigh, even as are the brute beasts in this manner and kind, as all do know.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;58.0;and all the time i did look through the bushes very fixedly into the eyes of the giants, and lo, their eyes did shine red and green, like to the eyes of animals.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG10662;58.0;and all the time i did look through the bushes very fixedly into the eyes of the giants, and lo, their eyes did shine red and green, like to the eyes of animals.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;58.0;and shoutings of great voices there were, and the thudding of huge feet all about, and the noises of the bushes rustling, but presently the search drew away to the southward.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;58.0;and i gat me about, and went swift through the moss-bushes to the north and west for three hours, and ceased not to run upon my hands and knees.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;59.0;and i did seem to know the sound upon the moment, for my heart grew swift to understand.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;61.0;now, as you shall suppose, i went very cautious through the bushes, unto that red-shining fire, being careful, both that i did attract not any evil force that might listen in the night, and because that there might be some monster nigh to the fire-hole.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;61.0;but, presently, when i was come so that i could peer through the bushes, i did see a little fire-hole set in a small hollow, and there did no thing seem to lurk anigh, and the sight of that warmth did cheer me, for it was long since i did have the comfort of such a matter.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;62.0;then did i perceive that i was all surrounded, and i ran swift upon the heaving sand, unto the edge of the fire-hole, and i turned there, and looked quickly, for i did not know what this new terror should be.
spider;Araneae;organism;PG10662;63.0;but this was not the end, as i did hope, for the yellow thing arose, and ran at me, as it might be that you should see a spider run.
claw;Amniota;body;PG10662;63.0;and i was covered with the muck of the thing, and the claws upon the legs seized me, so that the grey armour did bend and crack to the might thereof, and i grew sick unto death with the pain within, but smote with the shining diskos, using my left hand weakly, for my right was gript dreadful fast to my body.
claw;Amniota;body;PG10662;63.0;then i saw there was no great wound anywhere upon me, but only an utter bruising, and i found upon my right leg that there was a sharp and hairy claw clipt about it, but the armour had saved me from harm of the horrid thing, so that i did but kick it free with my left foot, and thence into the fire-hole.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;66.0;and at the eighteenth hour of each journey, i made a place for my slumber, and the first i did manage under a thick bush, but the second was high upon the ledge of a rock that grew upward in the night amid the bushes.
scorpion;Scorpiones;organism;PG10662;66.0;and, indeed, there was naught in that part of my journey, save that i did pass nineteen great fire-holes, and four small, and did observe no life beside any, save about one of the great holes that there was no hollow around, and here i did happen to see some strange and ugly creatures so big as my head, that did have a look of the scorpion of this age, but proportioned more squat and thick.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;67.0;yet, though this dear and homely sympathy was a sweet and companionable thing to my heart, it came swift to my thought that i was in a sore danger, if that they ceased not quickly to think so onely upon me, for surely was i not come over-near unto that dreadful house of silence, and well might so much emotion of the millions tell unto the horrid power that dwelt within, how that i was even anigh.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;68.0;now, i did stand there but a moment it did seem, to make an anxious considering how that i might best assure me some chance to live through this swift coming danger.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;68.0;then, in a moment, i did hear the great beast, for it bayed but a little way up the stream, as that it had overshot the place where the scent did end.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10662;68.0;and in a moment i saw it coming, and it was a little vague, by reason of the smoke of the river, yet did seem black and monstrous in the gloom, and great as a mighty horse.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;68.0;then i put upward my head, and took swift and deep breathings, and lookt about me, very cautious and fearful, as you can know.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;68.0;and i heard the night-hound casting round among the moss-bushes, and it did send up a wild and awesome baying, and i heard the bushes brake and smash beneath it, as it did run to and hither.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;68.0;yet, i ceased not to be full of an horrid unease, concerning the great beast, for i did better to know what it did, than to have no knowing.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;69.0;and as the great night-hound past me, it tore the earth and the bushes, with the exceeding strength that it put forth to run, and clods of the earth and stones of bigness were cast this way and that by the feet of the hound, running.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;69.0;and so shall you have a little knowledge of the strength of that beast.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;69.0;and i dared not to go outward upon that naked land, for then i had not been hid by the moss-bushes, but had stood plain there for all things of the night to behold, and moreover, though i could nowise have a sure knowledge concerning this matter, yet did i hope within me that i should make a sure hiding from the power of the house of silence, did i but go very low among the bushes.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;69.0;and because of this, i went backward among the bushes, and ceased to escape out unto the westward.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;69.0;and i found presently, that the moss-bushes made but a narrow growth in that path, and grew only for a while by the side of the great road, so that i was surely fain to keep nigh to the road, that i have the covering of the bushes.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;69.0;and so shall you have mind of me, hid there among the bushes, and sodden and cold, and yet, as you will perceive, so held in my spirit by an utter terror and loathing and solemn wonder and awe of that mighty house of quietness loomed above me in the night, that i wotted not of the misery of my body, because that my spirit was put so greatly in dread and terror for the life of my being.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;70.0;yet, as it did come about, i came presently clear of that horrid place, for the road came round again unto the north, and i began that i made a better way through the moss-bushes, but never that i grew to much speed, for i had oft to go about, that i should miss a naked part here, and another there, for truly there was an abundance and bareness of rock, so that the bushes grew not so thick as i could wish.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;70.0;for as i did go among the bushes, there broke sudden all around me in the aether, the low and solemn beat of the master-word.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;71.0;then, as i kneeled upward among the moss-bushes, and made to lay a true course unto the fire-hole, i perceived that there came a being along the road unto my right, and i went low into the bushes, and moved not, for truly i had seen that there drew nigh one of the silent ones.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;71.0;then did i make no waste of time, but set off unto the fire-hole, and kept so much to shelter as i might, but was oft made to run over baked places, ere that i should come to more of the bushes.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;72.0;yet did i stay among the bushes, though the road was true and smooth, by compare.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;72.0;and by this telling, you will perceive that i walked once more upright, and had given over to crawl between the bushes.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;77.0;but when the nations became road-makers, and came downward slowly to the monstrous deep of the mighty valley that did split the world, then were they come there by millions, and with power sufficient to fight against the beasts, and afterward to grow back again to an ancient civilizing, and so to the building of the great airships that were yet shown in the great museum of the pyramid.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;83.0;and i found me a neat and proper place, where three great trees grew about a little basin of rock that was very dry and warm.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;83.0;yet, as it did prove, there were many monstrous beasts in that country, but never did i feel the nearness and horrid power of any evil force, for these, as i do conceive, were congregate and gathered about the mighty pyramid, being attracted thereto by the great spiritual essence of so wondrous a multitude of humans gotten so close in one spot, even as sharks do come after the ship that hath bullocks within.
shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10662;83.0;yet, as it did prove, there were many monstrous beasts in that country, but never did i feel the nearness and horrid power of any evil force, for these, as i do conceive, were congregate and gathered about the mighty pyramid, being attracted thereto by the great spiritual essence of so wondrous a multitude of humans gotten so close in one spot, even as sharks do come after the ship that hath bullocks within.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;83.0;and oft did i find that the trees grew even into the water, so that oft did i go forward among the trees, and a very wonderful thing was this to me, that never had known before in all my life, until i was come into that country, how that a glad and wild mystery doth live among forest trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;84.0;and about each was there a deadness and desolation, where the fire had killed the big trees, yet, as i did observe, the quick life of little plants did grow more nigh, as that they were born and lived between the times of the fire-bursts.
plant;Plantae;organism;PG10662;84.0;and about each was there a deadness and desolation, where the fire had killed the big trees, yet, as i did observe, the quick life of little plants did grow more nigh, as that they were born and lived between the times of the fire-bursts.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;84.0;and in that one day i past thirty and seven boiling springs, but whether they boiled truly, i do have no knowledge, only that they sent out a great steam oft-times, and some did make a strong roaring noise, so that to hear them afar off in the forests was to think odd times that some wild beast roared strangely.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;84.0;for i saw, on the instant that i got me to mine elbow, how that certain things did crouch within the borders of the trees, no more than a score paces off.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;84.0;and i stared, the while that i did grip the diskos, and i saw that there were six squat men that were humpt at the neck and shoulder, and they did crouch all there in a row, and were something hid by the shadows, and i perceived that they watched me, and the eyes of the men did shine like the eyes of beasts, and so shall you know somewhat of the strange terror that came upon me.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;84.0;now, i looked presently, and found that i had slept five hours, and i eat two of the tablets, as i did stand there, watchful, and afterward drank some of the water, and so was ready to go forward again, for i was grown very anxious to be gone from that place, and did have no knowledge but that those strangely humpt men were but a little way off, among the trees, and might come upon me in a moment, or, further, that they did go to call an army of other humped men to my destruction.
dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10662;85.0;and in the mouth of this river, there was a small island, and surely i did look across to the island, and think it a refuge from the humped men that did surely play dog upon my going.
dog;Canidae;organism;PG10662;85.0;and in the mouth of this river, there was a small island, and surely i did look across to the island, and think it a refuge from the humped men that did surely play dog upon my going.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;85.0;yet, as it did chance, the need to go forward, and the danger of the humped men, put wit into me, so that i lookt about for a tree that was fallen.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;85.0;and there were many, yet great, so that i was much wearied and something strained of the spirit, before that i gat two little trees unto the water.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;85.0;now, when this was done, i made me a rough pole of a young tree-plant, and afterward, i lashed the two trees together with my belts and straps, and so had somewhat of a raft.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;86.0;and when i was come proper awake, i eat two of the tablets, and drank some of the water, and afterward made an end of my voyage, and then did take back my belts and straps from binding the trees, and so forward again upon my way, and no more fearful of the humped men, for, surely, i did think i had left them all upon the far shore of the river, though afterward i minded me that they might grow likewise upon the two sides, but yet was i only discovered by those upon the one, as you do know.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;86.0;and at times i was among trees, but oft did go past unnumbered boiling springs and small fire-hills, and oft was the air full of the noise of the little fire-hills, and the roar of the boiling springs, but there came no harm unto me.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;86.0;and oft did i come to parts where a great life held the trees, and green stuff did flourish exceedingly, and the air rich and full and wondrous sweet, so that i was fain to think how that in some far-off time, it might be that our children's children should come down unto this country, when the upper valley of the night land was grown to an utter chill and lacking of air, and here build them a new refuge, if, indeed any should come clear of the evil forces and the monsters that did live about the mighty pyramid in the night land.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;86.0;now, a little before the eighteenth hour was come, i came out from among the trees, and the sea was downward of a great cliff unto my right, for i had gone upward for a long and weary hour.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;86.0;and upon the upper part, there grew trees and green things, even as these did grow upon odd ledges of the upstanding rock.
cat;Felis;organism;PG10662;87.0;and in that moment that i slew him, i did note curiously how that he had large teeth upon each side of the mouth, and was aware that he had come so quiet as a great cat.
tiger;Puma concolor;organism;PG10662;88.0;and in that moment, he made unto me with so mighty a leap as any tiger should give.
tiger;Parantica;organism;PG10662;88.0;and in that moment, he made unto me with so mighty a leap as any tiger should give.
panther;Puma concolor;organism;PG10662;88.0;now, seeing that he was something feared of the weapon, i ran in upon him, and smote again at the face, yet was the man gone out of my reach before that the blow did reach, for, truly, he was quick as a panther.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;89.0;and truly, as i did look from this place and from that place, it was scarce a thing for wonder that i had not wotted it to be an air vessel, for there were great trees and abundance of earth and living matters upon the topmost side of the ship, so that none could easy perceive it to be aught save a great and desolate rock that did lie upon the other rock.
plant;Plantae;organism;PG10662;90.0;and after that i had climbed this way and that way, i perceived that i must come to the topmost part by the plants that did hang over, and grow downward.
ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10662;90.0;yet, oft did i think upon that ship hid there upon the mighty rock, under the wondrous quiet ashes of eternity.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10662;90.0;and i went eighteen hours walking, and in all that time i did see no more of the humped men, yet three times was i put in a sudden danger, for there went past me thrice, between the fourteenth and the seventeenth hours, great flying monsters, that were winged very ugly, and did go, as i thought, in a great bounding, rather than that they did fly proper as doth a bird.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;90.0;yet i suffered no hurt from these, for i was swift to hide between the great boulders that were very plenty in that part, but no trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;90.0;for i was gone now past the forests of trees, there being none since that i had gone through a very shallow river, that i came to about the thirteenth hour.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;91.0;but afterward, i considered i did be a fool, to lack such, for truly the trees were plentiful, and i could climb a great one, and strap my body safe, and so have a sure bed for my rest.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;91.0;and i did this thing, and went upward into a great tree, and did tie my body to the tree, with my belts, yet i eat and drank before that i went up the tree.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;91.0;now when i was fast upward in the tree, and had made a bed upon a monstrous branch, and had the diskos ready upon my hip, so that it should not fall but be nigh to my hand, i lay a little while thinking upon naani, and i went not over to sleep immediately, which was strange, yet mayhaps because that my bed was so uncertain.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;91.0;and odd whiles i did lie with mine eyes half to open, and did look very dreamful upward among the dark branches of the tree, as they did show black and pretty against the redness of the shining that came from the sea, for there was stood a great and bright-burning fire-hill in that part of the sea that lay off the shore from me.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;92.0;and, in a moment, there came seven humped men, running among the trees, as that some monstrous thing did pursue.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;92.0;and immediately they were beneath the tree in which i did lie, so that a great fear came upon me, and i loosed the belt from the branch, that i should be free to fight.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;92.0;and, directly upon this, i saw that the men did leap upward into the tree, beneath me, but not as that they did wot of me or make to come at me, but as that they did pay a great heed to some creature or happening that was far off among the trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;92.0;and, alway the noise did come the more anigh, and i saw that a humped man did come running from among the trees, and did run beneath that place where the seven humped men did be on the branches.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;92.0;and immediately i saw how this thing was, for the humped man upon the ground, did not run so fast as might be, and i conceived that he did act to make some creature to come after him, to pass under the men within the tree.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;92.0;and it did go under the tree in which i was hid, and in that moment when it past under the tree, the seven humped men did leap out of the branches, and did catch to the brute by the great horns of the spine, and i saw that the wounds were in the joints of the spine, as was plain when the back did work, with the going of the creature.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;92.0;and the seven humped men took the sharp stones from under their arms, and did strike very brutal in the wounds that were in the joints of the spine, and the creature roared and cried, and went onward into the trees at a great speed, and in all the time that it ran, the humped men ceased not to strike with the stones.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;92.0;and afterwards, they that lived, ran beyond the beast, and gat up into a second tree, and the one that was chased, did entice the creature to follow, and so did tease it once more to pass beneath the other men, and they very swiftly again to the back of the creature, and so from my sight, striking with the great stones, and the beast bellowing very loud and piteous.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;92.0;and afterwards, they that lived, ran beyond the beast, and gat up into a second tree, and the one that was chased, did entice the creature to follow, and so did tease it once more to pass beneath the other men, and they very swiftly again to the back of the creature, and so from my sight, striking with the great stones, and the beast bellowing very loud and piteous.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;93.0;and afterward, i gat me to the earth, and did look this way and that way, to see that no beast was anigh, neither any of the humped men, and afterward, i eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;94.0;and there was no way across, for there were no trees anigh, to make me a raft, neither might i wade across, for it might be shallow here and deep there, and the mud be in all places.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;94.0;and because of the light from the fire-pits, i did see, time and oft about the fires, horrid monsters, both that were snakes, and others like to scorpions so great as my head, but no more than these for a long while.
scorpion;Scorpiones;organism;PG10662;94.0;and because of the light from the fire-pits, i did see, time and oft about the fires, horrid monsters, both that were snakes, and others like to scorpions so great as my head, but no more than these for a long while.
spider;Araneae;organism;PG10662;95.0;and when i was come upward upon the ledge of the rock, i saw that there did seem something, like to a mighty spider, that did stay half without of a hole in the back part of the ledge.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;96.0;and then did i awake, and very thankful of the heart that no evil beast or creeping thing had come upon me whilst that i was so utter lost in sleep.
rat;Rattus;organism;PG10662;98.0;and i saw presently that there came certain creatures out from their holes, even as it might be that they were part rats, but very strange looking, and not properly such.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;98.0;and some did lie about the fire-hole, and some did hunt about in the rocks, and one came presently, and had a snake by the neck.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;98.0;and it stood upon the snake, and did eat it, even while that the snake did lash about upon the rock.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;98.0;and the snake did lash until that it was nigh all eat, and a very strange thing this was to see, and something troublesome to the pity.
rat;Rattus;organism;PG10662;98.0;and when the rat creature did make an end of the snake, it made across to the spring, and did drink the hot water a while, and afterward back unto the fire, and there laid down anigh to the edge, and seeming very sweetly comforted of the belly, which, in truth, was much otherwise with me.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;99.0;and i found the ground of that land to be very fair for my feet, and to have in this place and that certain bushes, even as it did seem to me, of the kind that we named moss-bushes in the night land, as you do know.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;100.0;and i made no great haste now to go unto that place, but went down sudden into the bushes, and lay upon my belly, and had a new great fear upon my spirit.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;100.0;and presently, i parted the bushes a little, and made a place for spying.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;100.0;but i made that i should get hence very quick, and i did turn me about in the bushes, and went upon my hands and knees, and so came at last a great way off.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;101.0;and i gat me down into the bushes which were very plentiful in that part.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;101.0;now, presently, i was come to a place where the land did go downward a great slope, and there was a difference in the earth that went beneath my feet, and no great plenty of the bushes, but only one in this place and one in that, and nowhere any fire-hole.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;102.0;and the thudding of the feet and the roaring went far off into the night, and there did seem presently to come back to me from a great way, a little screaming, but of this thing i had no surety, and i abode very hushed in a clump of bush, until quietness was come again all about, for there had been an utter frightening sound in the horrid voice and in the thudding of the great feet.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;102.0;but afterward, i ate and drunk, and went into a clump of bush, and wrapt the cloak about me, and so went fast unto sleep, with the diskos handy to my breast.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;102.0;and i leaned up upon mine elbow in the bush, and harked very quiet, perchance some noise had shaken my sleep from me.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;104.0;and i set me to run swift downward into the land, so that i should make a strong going unto the pyramid.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;105.0;in the same moment, and before that i made further speech unto naani, i did wot that someone did be a little way off from me, in the bushes, where a fire-hole did burn anigh to me, and it was as that my spirit knew this thing, and told of it unto my brain.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;106.0;and i made no answer unto the maid, across all the dark of the world, but went very swift into a great bush that was nigh to the fire-hole, upon this side.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;106.0;"i drew in my breath, and set my teeth a moment, to steady my lips, and i said,""mirdath,"" out of the bush where i did be, and using natural human speech."
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;106.0;and i divided the bush before me, and went through the bush, so that i came out before her, and did be there in my grey armour, and i did pause then, and was all adrift in myself, for my heart said that i should take this maid into mine arms again, for that i was come again to be with mirdath after an utter lost eternity.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;106.0;and in that same moment of my coming unto her out of the bush, she screamed and fell back from me, and strove weakly to gain unto the hither bushes, for, truly, she knew not what was come upon her in that first little moment.
palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10662;106.0;and i opened my left hand, and lookt at the hand within my palm, and surely it was utter thin and wasted.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;106.0;and i stript off my cloak very quick, and put it about her, for she was scarce covered with her clothes that had been all torn among the bushes, so that part she shook with an utter chill, and part because of weakness, for she was nigh to be starved unto her death, and destroyed with her grief and lonesomeness.
palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10662;107.0;and i gave up her hands, lest she need them for her tears, but she left them to lie in my palms, as she did kneel there, and she bowed her head a little over her weeping, but did show that she was mine, in verity, unto the very essence of her dear spirit.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;108.0;and there had been three maids with naani, when that she made escape into the night, but there had come certain creatures upon them, as they did sleep among the bushes, and had stolen two, and the other maid had run off, as did naani, and they had neither met the other any more.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;108.0;and her callings had told unto the evil things of the land that she did be in this part and that, for there had come things and beasts in search for her, but having the gift of the hearing, she had known of their approach, most whiles, and had come free from them, yet oft-times with piteous and fearful runnings and hiding among the rocks and the bushes, so that she had grown afterward to make no calling unto me, save odd whiles, lest she bring the monsters upon her.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;108.0;and her callings had told unto the evil things of the land that she did be in this part and that, for there had come things and beasts in search for her, but having the gift of the hearing, she had known of their approach, most whiles, and had come free from them, yet oft-times with piteous and fearful runnings and hiding among the rocks and the bushes, so that she had grown afterward to make no calling unto me, save odd whiles, lest she bring the monsters upon her.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;108.0;and because that she was so sorely chased, she had come nigh to be naked, even as i found her, for the bushes and the rocks had torn her garments from her, and she had naught with which to make any proper mending of them.
plant;Plantae;organism;PG10662;108.0;and for food she had eat the moss upon the rocks, and odd strange berries and growths, and had drunk of the waters of the hot springs, and oft had she been made utter sick, because of the sulphur, or somewhat, of the water and, maybe, the poison of odd plants.
moss;Bryophyta;organism;PG10662;108.0;and for food she had eat the moss upon the rocks, and odd strange berries and growths, and had drunk of the waters of the hot springs, and oft had she been made utter sick, because of the sulphur, or somewhat, of the water and, maybe, the poison of odd plants.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;108.0;and the maid told me how that she came once upon certain of the peoples of the lesser redoubt, as they did hide among the bushes, but they ran, with no heed to her callings that she did be human, even as they, and by this is it plain the sore and dreadful panic that was upon the hearts of such.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;108.0;moreover, there were snakes about the fires, though not over-plentiful in all parts, and there did be spider-crabs and monstrous scorpions.
scorpion;Scorpiones;organism;PG10662;108.0;moreover, there were snakes about the fires, though not over-plentiful in all parts, and there did be spider-crabs and monstrous scorpions.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10662;108.0;and, indeed, even as she had lain by the fire-hole, very weak and seeming near unto her death, even this time when my call had come unto her to stir her unto life and bitter knowledge of despair, even then was she all surround by creatures that were like to crabs, that did squat all about her, and did but wait for her to die, so that she had been feared to sleep, lest they destroy her in her slumber.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;109.0;and immediately, i had come out of the bush, and she had fallen back in a sudden great fear that a monster was stolen upon her, and then did see a young man in grey armour, and did know in one instant that i was that olden one of her memory dreams, and the one that had spoken unto her in the spirit across half of the dead world, as it did seem.
crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10662;109.0;yet a true crab of this day been wishful to pinch me, had i put my toe forth unto it.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;109.0;and afterward, i put on the armour again, but the suit i folded, and laid beside the maid, for, truly, she was nigh unclothed, by reason of the bushes and the rocks, that had rent her garments all-wise.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;120.0;but, indeed, i discovered nothing of any greatness, yet i saw three snakes, and there were, beside, two scorpion-creatures, as i did name them, that neither went backward from me, nor came against me, but did bide where i saw them, each in an hole of the rock.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;120.0;and, indeed, in a little while she saw a snake go among the rocks, and she then to be very eager that we find some place that should be secure from creeping things.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;121.0;and the shining of the fire-hole made them plain seen and clear, and they did be both men and women, and were but in rags or utter naked, and all torn by the rocks and the bushes, and did seem, indeed, as that they had been wild things that did go by so swift and lost.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;122.0;and i perceived in the same instant why that she did go stealthy and swift in that fashion, and to cower, as for her very life, for there came a squat, haired man, so broad as a bullock, who did come silent down into the hollow, looking this way and that, even as a wild beast doth peer, very sudden.
tiger;Puma concolor;organism;PG10662;122.0;and i smote at the squat man, even as it did leap silent upon me, as a tiger doth leap, making no sound.
tiger;Parantica;organism;PG10662;122.0;and i smote at the squat man, even as it did leap silent upon me, as a tiger doth leap, making no sound.
talon;Amniota;body;PG10662;122.0;and the brute-man caught me by the legs, to rip me, and i cut quick with the diskos, and it did have but one monstrous talon left unto it.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;125.0;and we journeyed with a care alway that we show not ourselves over-plain unto the light that shone over the land from the great pit, and oft we did creep a while over this stark place and that, and went nimbly amid the bushes that grew oft in great parts.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;127.0;and there was no more any sound of the spinning, only there did be, as it were, the trunk of a great tree, that did show in the glowing, and the trunk of the tree came toward us across the darkness.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;127.0;and i turned the maid from the tree, and she did flutter a little in my hands, as i did know, scarce-knowing, for she perceived that she did be going to die in that moment.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;127.0;the tree came no more anigh to us, but went backward, and the pale glowing did fade, and the tree no more to be seen.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;127.0;and i held her, and lookt alway about us, lest the tree come in upon the other side.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;127.0;and my heart did leap with an holy joy and an utter great thankfulness, and i was no more in fear of the tree, for, in verity, there fought for our souls one of those sweet powers of goodness, that did strive ever to stand between the forces of evil and the spirit of man, and this matter have i shown to you, before this time.
palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10662;128.0;and i sat beside the maid, and made her to eat a tablet, and saw that the cloak did be nice about her, and her head to rest against my knee, and i laid the palm of my hand to be as a pillow, because of the armour, to ease the hardness.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;129.0;and the man roared and shriekt, even as a wild and dreadful beast should cry out, and came round upon me with the two lower arms.
talon;Amniota;body;PG10662;129.0;and surely it was a mighty and brutish thing, and so broad and bulkt as an ox, and the lower arms were huge and greatly haired, and the fingers of the hands did have the nails grown into horrid talons, as that they should grip very bitter.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;129.0;and so i did be an horrid minute, and fought with the beast, with no more than the strength of my body, and it was as that an human went with his hands to slay a monster so strong as an horse.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10662;129.0;and so i did be an horrid minute, and fought with the beast, with no more than the strength of my body, and it was as that an human went with his hands to slay a monster so strong as an horse.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;130.0;the creature did work slow in the brain, and in the end loost from me, abrupt, and went back with a leap, so that my hands did be ript from the throat of the beast.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;130.0;and i gat the beast in the throat, and the beast went backward to the earth, even as it did think to hold me.
grunt;Haemulon;organism;PG10662;130.0;and the yellow beast-man grunted upon the ground, and it rose up again to come at me, and it stood and did grunt, and did seem as that it was gone mazed, for it did make other sounds, and an horrid screeching, so that truly, by the way of it, i conceived that it cried out unknown and half-shapen words at me.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;131.0;and i did peer everywhere about, lest that some other evil thing come outward of the bushes, to have at us ere i did ware.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;131.0;and, truly, the bushes grew here and there in that place, very plentiful, in great dumpings.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;133.0;and by this devising, i conceived that any beast or monstrous thing that should climb upward whilst that we slept, should be like to set the rock adrift, and mayhaps the rock to work an harm to such, but the chief end to be that i should be swiftly waked by the noise.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;134.0;but she called unto me that i lie backward, for that she did mean gently to spoil me that once, and that i have no heed to the boulder or whether there did be any monster or beast anigh in the gorge, for that the boulder did be safe as i did balance it, and nowheres any creature to sight in the gorge, for she had lookt oft, since waking, to this end.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;136.0;and so we did go, and alway with a good caution, lest that some beast or creature should come upon us, and alway with the fire-holes before and behind, and in the air of the gorge the little whistlings of steam that did spirt out in this place and that, and a good warmth in many parts, by reason of the fires, and odd whiles a smelling of sulphur, but not greatly, nor to our trouble.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;136.0;and i saw that there did be no snakes, neither any of the rat-things anigh, and so i had the maid to sit very comfortable on the side of the pool, and i freed her shoes, and bathed her feet, and afterward rubbed them very steady with the ointment, and so for a good time, and alway to keep a looking out upon the gorge.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;138.0;and when we had our gear together, i left it in the cave, and took mine own over unto the hot pool that was anigh to the fire-pit, and she to exclaim upon the rat-thing that did be yet a-slumber upon the side of the fire-pit, and i to say that the thing did be no cause for fear, but rather, indeed, a good friend, in that it was a devourer of snakes, as you shall mind.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;143.0;and the maid to be there, a little figure, and white in the face, and strangely angered, and her anger mixt with hidden acknowledgement that i did be her master, and half to be minded that she move not from where she did stand, and part to be reasonable and fearful of the hidden beast, and in part also to thrill in her womanhood unto the man that did be so masterful unto her.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;144.0;and immediately i saw the great and monster head of the beast come forward into the shine from the pit, and the head did be of a blotched white, and to have the eyes upon great stalks that came from the forward part of the head, and the stalks to be set downward, so that the eyes lookt upon the bottom parts of the gorge.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;145.0;and, indeed, i saw it not so plain as might be, because of the haze of the fumes and the smoke that did lie in the air of the gorge, as i have told, and made something vague the sight at this time and that, but yet we did both see a strange thing, for when that the great white body did be come half into the light, the slug-beast set out a big tongue among the boulders, after that it did peer thereunder, and the tongue did be very long, and white, and something thin-seeming, and the monster lapped inward in a moment a great snake from among the boulders, and the tongue did hold upon the snake, as that there did be surely teeth or roughness upon the tongue, but yet the distance to be too great for any surety of the sight, as you do know, and moreover, there did be the uncertainty of the haze within the air.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;145.0;and the slug took the snake inward, all as it did lash and wriggle, and swallowed it in a moment, and, in verity, that snake did be a big and horrid creature, else had it been not so plain to our sight, but it did be as a worm unto the monster, and gone instant.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;145.0;and immediately, the slug-beast went again to searching, and the head to sway from this side unto that side of the gorge, and by the wideness and ease of this swaying shall you perceive the utter greatness of the beast.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;145.0;and again, we saw the beast set the tongue in among the boulders of the gorge bottom, and it lickt forth a snake that did seem so thick as a man in the body, and the snake to thrash in the great white tongue, and to be immediately drawn inward, and gone utter.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;145.0;and again, we saw the beast set the tongue in among the boulders of the gorge bottom, and it lickt forth a snake that did seem so thick as a man in the body, and the snake to thrash in the great white tongue, and to be immediately drawn inward, and gone utter.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;145.0;but yet, as it is like to be, mayhap the snakes did be only anigh to the fire-holes, yet doth it be anywise a wondrous thing that we had come so free of them alway, and truly to learn, was to be given a new terror.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;145.0;now the monster was come fully into the shining of the fire-pit, and was upon this side, and the fire to make a shining against the side of the slug, so that odd whiles i did perceive very plain the huge wrinklings and musclings of the skin, as the beast made onward.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;145.0;i saw that the beast did scent of us, and made to come upward to destroy us.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;145.0;and as the mighty hill of the body did come into length against the great cliff-side, the beast set the eye-stalks into this cave and that, as it did go, and into all crannies, and so lengthened upward very straight and monstrous and dreadful unto us, and did be as a white and mildewed hill, that had an horrid life.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;146.0;and a great steam of dread breathing to go upward from the beast, and a reek, and it made again the strange and horrid noise of pain, and the gorge to be yet full of the echoes of the rock thundering, and with the noise of the rock there was now mingled the horrid sounding of the death-crying of the beast.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;147.0;and everywhere, the skin of the beast did be set into great wrinklings, and horrid blotchings to be upon the improper whiteness thereof, and truly i did be in haste that i turn the maid away from that thing, and that we haste downward of the gorge.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10662;148.0;and we did go almost in joyous-wise, because that we were come safe out of that dreadful place, and surely, odd whiles i did feel the hands of mine own naughty one to be hookt very pretty and sly into the backward part of my belt, as that she did make a pretending that she drive me before her, and surely this doth be a strange thing to tell upon, for there did be no knowledge of the olden horse in all the eternity of that dark world, but yet, maybe, some dear olden memory-dream did set her hands unconscious to this pretty work.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;148.0;and, in verity, once i turned very sudden, and had her swift into mine arms, as she did pretend to drive me, and she to laugh with a sweet and joyous gurgle against mine armour, and i to heed that i hurt her not, because i did be like an iron man that should put arms about a tender maid.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;149.0;and, in verity, i did mind now, how that she did look very beautiful in her bath, as i had gone to succour her from the snake, and i to be nicely wholesome in this remembering, because of my love, but yet to be knowing that i was sweetly stirred to new things, and did not know before that a maid lookt in the same moment so holy and so human.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;150.0;now i washt me, not by going down into the pool, for indeed i did not wot whether there be any more snakes hid there in some other hole.
palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10662;151.0;and when she did rest, i lookt to her pretty feet, and rubbed them very gentle and constant with the ointment, and surely they did be pretty well, but i to like that i should tend them, and to have joy to feel their littleness within my palms, and surely she did know how it did be with me, for presently she took her feet inward under the cloak, and i, maybe, to look something woeful, for she put one out presently, when that i did the least expect, and slipt it very cosy into my hand, and surely i kist her naughty toes, and she then to be very sedate.
spider;Araneae;organism;PG10662;152.0;and i carried mine own then for four hours, and in the eighteenth hour we were come to that part of the gorge where did be the ledge where i killed the spider, ere i slept, as you shall mayhap to mind.
scorpion;Scorpiones;organism;PG10662;153.0;and oft as we did go, there were great scorpions in the path, and odd whiles they to have no heed to go from my way, but to be so great as my head, and very fat and lazy, so that surely i kickt a good number, from my path, even as you shall kick a ball with the foot, and three i burst in this way.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;153.0;and likewise, in this place and that, there were snakes, but none to come anigh to me, and i to choose alway the open goings, for i did think there to be many hid snakes and lesser monsters in the dark places between the great boulders.
snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10662;154.0;and this time and that there did be a snake to go by us, and the scuttling of the monster scorpions, and mayhap a moving in the shadows of the great boulders, that did tell me there went maybe some peculiar monster in that place, so that i did be very wary, and to have the diskos alway ready.
scorpion;Scorpiones;organism;PG10662;154.0;and this time and that there did be a snake to go by us, and the scuttling of the monster scorpions, and mayhap a moving in the shadows of the great boulders, that did tell me there went maybe some peculiar monster in that place, so that i did be very wary, and to have the diskos alway ready.
palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10662;155.0;and she very quick and naughty to put her hand between our lips, and i then to kiss the palm, that did be in my way, and did be very small and pretty.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;155.0;and, surely, when she did be come right round, and to face me again, and had a very sedate look, she stretched out her pretty foot, all in a moment, and put her pink toes sudden upon my lips, and i to be so in surprise, that i had not wit to do aught, ere she had them back swift from me.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG10662;156.0;and she gat thence the comb that was a fitment, and did comb her pretty hair, and i to sit and talk with her, and to jest, with a heart that did be so light as it had not been for a great while, for though i did dread the humpt men and the monstrous animals of the country of seas, i had not any abiding horror of aught that i had seen in that country, for there seemed a naturalness in all things, so that i did have no loathing, neither any fear of an evil force.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;157.0;and the maid now to perceive the trees, which did be in great forests unto our right hand, while that the shore of the sea did go alway upon our left.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;157.0;and she to be utter in wonder of the trees, and to need that she pluck branches, and smell of them and look at each leaf, and so to be all stirred, for never in that life did she to have seen such a matter as those great trees did be, but yet to be all stirred by vague memories that did seem no more than dreams.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;157.0;and when we did go thiswise for seven good hours, we were come nigh opposed to the bright-burning fire-hill that did be offward in the sea, and had made me a warm light in that time when i did sleep in the tree, as you do remember.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;158.0;and, in verity, i had set off our hour for food, because that i saw we did come nigh to the place where the tree did be, and i to know that the maid should like to eat and drink anigh to that place, and to know that i did sleep there.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;158.0;and surely i took her to the tree, and when that i told her, she to beg me that i indulge her and that we go upward to that branch where i did sleep, and there to eat our tablets.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;158.0;and truly, i told her about the great beast, when we were come down again to the earth, and she to cry out and to show me that there did be yet the mark where the belly of the monstrous beast did brush upon the earth, as it ran, and moreover the broken places of the foot-marks, and she by this to see how great a beast it did be, but yet did it be a little thing beside the slug, only that it did be a thing of horn and hardness of skin, as you have perceived.
bird;Aves;organism;PG10662;160.0;and this eagerness of haste to be, because of the great bird things which i had seen to go bounding over that waste, when that i was upon mine outward way.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;160.0;and she, as i could know, to be strangely in love that her gentle body be bruised by the hardness of mine armour, and if this might not be, she to be not wishful that she wear her torn clothing upon her neat suit and so to seem careless and to lack to be dainty in mine eyes, for, indeed, she did be alway to wash herself and to make tidiness, and she to have a way now that she did set the armour-suit upon her, that had it to seem different, and she to have set a little sprig from the trees upon her breast, and in her girdle, and so to seem the more of a maid, and surely a man doth know and love these things, but not alway to have full knowing how that they be done.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;162.0;and the maid to leap sudden from mine arms, that i be free with the diskos, and i to look swift to her, and to see that she have her knife ready in her hand, that she might chance to aid me.
bat;Chiroptera;organism;PG10662;162.0;and the bird-creature lay all spread upon the stones and the rock of that place, and surely it did be as that it were leathern, and made somewise as a bat doth be of this age, in that it did have no feathers.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10662;162.0;and, truly, it lookt mighty, where it did be spread, and indeed the body to be full so big as the body of a young horse, and the bill to be very deadly and sharp and cumbrous, as you to have guessed.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;163.0;and when that we had crost the river, it did be full one and twenty hours since that we slumbered, as you shall know, if that you but count a little, for you do mind that we spent a certain time within the tree, as i have told, and this not to have been proper counted into the time of our journeying.
plant;Plantae;organism;PG10662;163.0;and she to yearn, as i could know, that she have some way to feed me, but truly there did be no way, for we thought not to make to slay aught for our purpose, and we did be feared that we eat any root or plant, lest that we be ill.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10662;164.0;and, surely, i laughed gently at the maid, because that she should be so dainty a glutton, but for my part, i to feel that i could eat an horse, as we do say in this age.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;164.0;and when that we did be gone all-ways, and no cave proper to our sight, we found a great tree, that did be set off alone, and had a plenty of branches, but none that did be near to the bottom-part.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;164.0;and surely, i gave the maid a lift, and held her up so far as mine arms did go, so that she might stand upon the palms of my hands, and be steady against the trunk of the tree, and she thiswise to have a hold upon a branch, and so to go upward.
palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10662;164.0;and surely, i gave the maid a lift, and held her up so far as mine arms did go, so that she might stand upon the palms of my hands, and be steady against the trunk of the tree, and she thiswise to have a hold upon a branch, and so to go upward.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;164.0;and we climbed upward then, and so came to a part of the tree where the branches did be very thick together, and we made here a place for our slumber, and the maid set the cloak over the branches that did be so close, and afterward we lay down, but first i set the strap about her waist, and thence to a branch, and she to refuse sleep until that i be likewise, so that we did be both very safe from any fall.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;165.0;and afterward, i climbed to the topmost branches of the tree, and lookt well over the country all about, but there was no brutish thing to my sight in any place, neither near nor far.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;166.0;and i to be as that i drew my breath anigh to tears, and did be there with naani amid the quiet spareness of the trees and the rock of that part of the land, but yet did be to see half dimly that i stood within a light, even as the light that doth be the wonder of olden sunsets, and i to be, in the same time, both that man and this man that now doth write, and to have beside my spirit but one maid, that i did lack to know whether i say to her naani or mirdath, for though the two that have been mine own did be different-seeming to the eye, there to be but the spirit of one maid beside me in that moment.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;167.0;in a moment this to go, and i to be in that country of the seas, and to look newly unto naani, and she to go as i have told, and there to be the lonesome trees and the rocks in all parts for a great way about.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;167.0;now, in a while, we past a basin of rock, in a place among the trees, and there was a warm spring bubbling in the rock, and the basin to be full of water, very warm and with some smelling of chemistry.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;169.0;and indeed i pulled a small branch from a tree that did be near, to be for a switch as you shall whip a boy with, and i held her with my left hand, and in verity i laid the switch thrice very sharp across her pretty shoulders, that she know all that she did need to know.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;173.0;and presently, when that we did be come down from that high place where did be set the rock and the olden ship, we came in among the trees that came very nigh to the shore for a great way, and oft as we did go, there were clumpings of small fire-hills that did cast fire and noise, and oft the roaring of monstrous springs a-boil, and then again the smell of the woods about us, and oft still in odd places the low near sound of a little fire-hill, that did burn, lonesome, in some clear space of the woods, in this place and that, and afterward we to be gone onward again into the dull low mutter that did be in all the air of that country, and that did but make a seeming of silence, because that it did be so far and constant.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;173.0;now, about the eighteenth hour i to note that the noise of the great fire-hills grew more loud, and i saw presently over the trees, afar upward in the great night and gloom that did lie above, those two mighty fire-hills that i did feel to make the earth tremble, in that part, upon mine outward way.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;173.0;but yet there to be no desolation around, as you should think, but in all parts a wondrous growing of trees and great plants in abundance.
plant;Plantae;organism;PG10662;173.0;but yet there to be no desolation around, as you should think, but in all parts a wondrous growing of trees and great plants in abundance.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;173.0;and the trees to grow upward upon the shoulders of the mountain, and there to be no falling of hot rocks and ash, as you to think, but all very sweet and wholesome, as that the mighty valley made a chimney to the mountain, and mayhap to others, so that their waste, if that they had such, did go free.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;174.0;and presently the land did go upward with a monstrous sweep, and was then in great terraces in the height, and trees to grow very plentiful upon the mountains, in sundry parts, and so those two mighty hills to go upward to meet the everlasting night, and presently to show strange uplands that did be seen very wondrous and queer in the light that did glow from the vast glowing of the fire that did be a crown upon the hills, that did seem in verity to be that they burned halfway between that known world, and the lost olden world, that was mayhap two hundred great miles above in the everlasting night and eternity of darkness.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;176.0;and anon there to be a small wood, and again a wood, and oft the quietness of great and strange trees, that did stand alone.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;176.0;and here, as i do mind, there was a strangeness, in that there did be many trees that had stones set in the branches, and this to be plainly the work of the little fire-hill, and i to think it but something new come, else surely there had been no trees within all that space that it did throw, but yet, mayhap, i am wrong in this, for all things did seem that they grew very easy in that country, and indeed this to be for surprise to me, only that i saw it with mine own eyes, as we do say.
ant;Formicidae;organism;PG10662;178.0;and truly, this doth be very contrary-seeming, only that you have seen my heart, and all indeed the more human, that it doth be so contrariwise to the brain-reason, and all to be desired, else did a man be no better than an ant or a weariful machine.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;179.0;and so we did go, and i never to speak with the maid, but to wonder when that she cease, or how long it should be ere that i did run swift to her and have her into mine arms, that i shake her and kiss her, all as my heart did desire.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;179.0;but afterward, i ceased from these feelings, and did be intent to another matter, for it did seem to my spirit that there was some danger anigh to us, and i had a thought of the humpt men, and lookt well about, and did beckon the maid to come nigh, because that the trees did be plentiful thereabout, to hide any creature.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;179.0;and she made that she saw me not, but did set the gear together, and had it presently a-ready for the journey, the while that i did look all-ways among the trees, but indeed i saw naught.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;179.0;and when that i had the gear upon me, and the maid her bundle, we went forward again, and i to be very wary, and bid the maid keep close to my side, but indeed, she would not obey, and went offward among the trees, so that i was all an-haunted with dread for her, and ran and caught her, and talkt wisely with her, but indeed she did not hark to me, but did run off in the moment that i loost her.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;179.0;and truly, she had cut the strap with her belt-knife, and did run away very swift among the trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;179.0;and surely my heart did slow a little in my breast, because that there did seem something a-move in the dark of the shadows, where the trees did grow thick, and the maid did run that way in her foolishness and waywardness.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;179.0;when i caught her, i shook her, and pointed inward among the trees, for it did seem even then to me that something moved there, but she to struggle in my hand a moment, and afterward to be still, and to ask with an insolence and a defiance whether that i did mean to flog my chattel, the which she did call herself in her naughtiness.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;180.0;but i took her into mine arms, very strong, and i ran outward from that place where the trees made a darkness.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;180.0;and surely, when i was come again to where the trees did be more spare, i saw that i was come nigh to that river which i crost on the raft, as you shall mind, and truly i did be glad, and to feel safe in a moment.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;181.0;and we went then at a good speed toward the river, for i was still minded regarding the seeming of movement which there had been among the trees, and very wishful that we have a raft made with haste, so that we might come to the little island, where i did sleep before, upon the outward way, as you shall remember.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;181.0;and we came downward to the shore of the river, and, indeed, there did be those two same trees, that had been my raft, there upon the shore of that place.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;181.0;now we lookt well in all parts, that we find some other small tree that should be fallen, and the maid did climb a rock that did be near, with a flat top, so that she might search out around.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;181.0;and presently she cried out to me that there did be a tree to our purpose, and but an hundred paces away, and she to go with me to show me, and to aid, if need be, but, indeed i carried the tree very easy, and had it with the others, and afterward, we went about again for branches, and these i cut from live trees, using the diskos with care and wiseness.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;182.0;and with these branches to be for cross-pieces, and our belts and the straps for binders, i set the trees together into a raft, and made it pretty good for our need, and so that no monstrous thing in the river should have chance to snap upward between the trees at my dear one.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;182.0;but first i did need a pole to push the raft, and did wonder now where the other did be gone, that i cut upon the outward way, for i had set the pole with the two trees, as i did mind, having some vague thought that mayhap i should live to come that way again.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;182.0;and i bid the maid put the scrip and the pouch and her bundle secure upon the raft, and in that time i lookt well about for a sapling tree that should do my purpose.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;182.0;in that moment, as i balanced the pole in my hands, there came the noise of a sudden bounding to our backward part, where the trees did grow something anigh.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG10662;182.0;and i had no time to the diskos, which did be upon the earth to my feet, and i smote the humpt man with the point of the pole that did be in my hands, and the point took him very strong and horrid in the breast, and entered in, so that the humpt man gave out a strange howling, that did be half seeming of an animal and half of an human.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;182.0;and i set her there upon the rock, and turned again to the way i came and swung the diskos free, for indeed, i had seen that there did come a number of the humpt men among the trees.
panther;Puma concolor;organism;PG10662;183.0;and surely, i must cease from my thinkings, and go forward with my telling, for the humpt men did come forward at a wondrous quick run, and did swarm upward on to the rock, as that they did be panthers, and they made no outcry, but came silent to the killing, and i saw that they did be something smaller than he that i had but then slain.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;185.0;she went about, and did run right away among the trees, and the three men did come after her, running very lumbersome, yet with a great speed.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;185.0;and the maid went from my sight among the trees, as a far white figure, that did run very swift, and was presently lost utter to my sight, and the humpt men did go after, yet even in my weakness, i perceived that two did go something clumsy, as that they had been hurt in the fight, and they to be the rearward of the chasing, but he that the maid did cut with the knife was to the fore, and did run very strong, and surely they were all gone inward of the trees with a dreadful speed, and were lost from me.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;185.0;and i knew that i was come to my feet, and did run toward the trees, and the diskos did trail from mine arm by the hold-buckle, and the ground did be as that it moved and shifted under me, and i not to feel where i trod, but did only peer desperate and lost among the trees, and, as i to know now, i heard my voice calling strangely, and afterward there was a thundering in mine ears, and i came downward upon my face.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;185.0;and i lookt among the trees, but there did be nothing, and everywhere there did be a strange silence and a dimness of unreal seemings.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;185.0;and there was a little strength come into me, and i gat my head up somewhat from the ground, and did peer among the trees, and my head did be too heavy, and my face came against the earth once more.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;185.0;there went something among the trees, and did show white in the gloom of the wood, and did come through the trees.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;186.0;and mine own drew nigh, and did rock and stagger, and did strike anon against the trunks of the trees, as that she did be gone near blind with her running.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;186.0;and i lookt down dull, yet with an utter great love upon mine own, and there did be no proper wound upon her, but yet was she all bruised and knockt and marked with the trees, and where she did fall in her running.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;188.0;and afterward, i found that she had made a very cunning mend of the garments, whilst that she did sit so utter long beside me to tend me, for she had gotten threads from her torn garments, and had made needles from thorns that did grow on the little bushes of the island, and the thorns did brake oft, and she then to have another, and so to persist an hundred times.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;190.0;and afterward, she went off from me a little, to her toilet, but i to ask that she be so swift as might be, and she to promise very merry, and she came back in a little while, and her hair to be in a lovely cloud about her shoulders, and her pretty feet yet to be bared from her bath, which she had in a pool beyond some bushes, and she to say that i did be so impatient a man, that she to be forced that she do the half of her dressing with me, but truly, she came thiswise only because she to know how i did delight in her thus, and to watch the way that she set up her abundance of hair, and she to be hungry also that she be with me, and to love me that i watch her, even while that there did be oft a little and quaint stirring of shyness in her dear heart.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10662;192.0;and we, in truth, never in that age to have seen or to have known that ever there did be an horse, or to mind the likeness of one.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10662;192.0;and, indeed, we did both to look one at the other, when that we had ended, and did wonder what an horse did be, yet in the same time did have a vague inward knowing.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;196.0;now when that i did come to my proper wakening, i to hear the fizzing of the water, and to know that the maid did be risen a good while, and had made her toilets, as i perceived in a moment, when that she came unto me, for her hair did be in a lovely cloud upon her shoulders, all combed and made ready against my waking, and she to have bathed, as i supposed, in some warm pool that did be among the bushes upon the island, and she now to slip her foot-gear, that her feet be bare unto me, as i did love, and to stand a moment, and her eyes to twinkle gently.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;199.0;and we went then together over all the little island, for i did search for some bush that should have a long tendril in plenty, and supple, and so to suit for binding.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;199.0;but, truly, there did be no such bush in all the island, and this to put me in trouble, as you shall suppose, yet was there a sufficient plenty of small and upright trees, that did seem very good for any purpose of structure.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10662;199.0;and, surely, even as the words did come from her, they to set me upon the thing that should supply our need, for i stoopt sudden to the grass that did grow oft and plenty in this place and that, and was so tall as my thigh, and to my head in the middle of the dumpings where it did sprout.
grass;Poaceae;organism;PG10662;199.0;and, surely, even as the words did come from her, they to set me upon the thing that should supply our need, for i stoopt sudden to the grass that did grow oft and plenty in this place and that, and was so tall as my thigh, and to my head in the middle of the dumpings where it did sprout.
grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10662;199.0;and we cut then a good arm-load of the grasses, using the knife, and had those to our camp, for we did be homely now unto that place, as you shall think.
grass;Poaceae;organism;PG10662;199.0;and we cut then a good arm-load of the grasses, using the knife, and had those to our camp, for we did be homely now unto that place, as you shall think.
grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10662;199.0;and the maid then to show me plaiting, and how that we could work in the grass piece by piece, so that we should plait unto any length that we to need.
grass;Poaceae;organism;PG10662;199.0;and the maid then to show me plaiting, and how that we could work in the grass piece by piece, so that we should plait unto any length that we to need.
grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10662;199.0;and all that day we workt, and did be very happy together, but when that we came to the time of our slumber, the maid had done twice and thrice so much as i, and surely she came over to me, and kist me very grave, that i should be not to fret, even as i did kiss her with gentle mocking concerning the thought about the grass, and so did she make level with me, by this impudence and quaint sweetness.
grass;Poaceae;organism;PG10662;199.0;and all that day we workt, and did be very happy together, but when that we came to the time of our slumber, the maid had done twice and thrice so much as i, and surely she came over to me, and kist me very grave, that i should be not to fret, even as i did kiss her with gentle mocking concerning the thought about the grass, and so did she make level with me, by this impudence and quaint sweetness.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;199.0;and on the next day, which did be the twelfth, i took the diskos, and on that day i cut down six of the trees, and alway the maid did bring her plaiting, that she be near me, and when i had cut the six trees, she had me to cease, lest that i risk to open any wound.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;200.0;and i cut seven more trees that day, which made thirteen in all, and afterward i trimmed the trees very nice.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;200.0;and whilst that the maid did plait, and make gentle and happy talk with me, i presently to sit beside her, and had her belt-knife to my need, and therewith, when i had cut bark from a tree, i made a foot-long cross-piece of wood which i did fasten with pegs and some lashing unto the end of one of the paddle-shafts.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;200.0;and we then to dance, half in play and half in victory, but gentle, and afterward she to come with me that she give me aid that we get the trees unto the water.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;201.0;and in six hours, we rolled the trees down to the shore, and did begin then that i lash the saplings across the trees, and thiswise to hold them secure into a raft.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;201.0;and the midmost tree i put something more forward than the next, and so, until that which did be the front was shaped somewise like to the bow of a ship.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10662;201.0;and the saplings to hold the trees thiswise, when that i had set the lashings about every sapling and every tree, where the saplings did go across.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;201.0;and naught to happen in all that time, save that once we did see a great beast to come upward lumbersome out of the sea on to the shore, and there did eat and browse upon the herbage in that part, or so it did seem to us, though, truly, we did be over far off to have surety.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;202.0;and this beast not to put us into any horror, but only to make us glad that we be afar off from it, and by this saying, i to mean that it did seem unto us a natural thing, and nowise to have an odour of aught monstrous to trouble our spirits.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;202.0;but this thinking also neither to offend me, that although much--and mayhap all--doth be modified and shapen diverse ways by the circumstance and the condition, yet doth there be an inward force that doth be peculiar each unto each, though, mayhap, to be mixt and made monstrous or diverse by foul or foolish breeding--as you to have knowledge of in the bodies of those dread monsters that did be both man and beast.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;203.0;now, there did be one other thing of note, beside the sea beast, whilst that we did be upon the seas, and this did be the strangeness of a great fire-hill which did stand in the sea, and we to pass very nigh unto it.
mourner;Rhytipterna;organism;PG10662;208.0;and with you that have love, i am as a brother in holy delight, but with all that have not known love, or to have missed love, i am a mourner, and my heart to pray that they to know this wonder, ere they die, for else shall they die so green and bitter as they be born, and to have grown nowise unto ripeness, which doth be charity--the end of life and the crown of humanity.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;208.0;yet, truly, i also never to have forgetting that this familiar land of strangeness did be the last test and the greatest dreadfulness of our journey, and anxiousness did hang upon me, for i now to have to take the preciousness of mine own among and beyond all that danger of horrid forces and of monstrous things and beast men, and the like.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;209.0;and it was as that her very being did know and be repulsed of some horror that did concern and be in that house, so that she to want to hide in the bushes that did be anigh to the road, and truly, i to think this wise, and to remember and to be ware suddenly that we did be indeed come now into the power of monstrosity which did be utter and forever abroad in that land.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;209.0;and surely, we went then in among the bushes that did grow clumpt upon the side of the road, as you to remember, and afterward, i calmed this new fear that had come so quick upon mine own, and she then to peer forth with me from the bushes, and to have renewed sight over the land.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;209.0;but this to have been in the main, because of the utter care that i did need to bring me safe past the house, for i to have gone long and weary upon my hands and knees among the bushes, as you remember, and oft to pause, and to be so still as death, lest that the power of the house to have become aware of my passing.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;209.0;and, indeed, after that we had peered a good while from the bushes, i to consider that we do well to eat now, and afterward to have a safe place for our slumber, so that we go fresh to the horrid dangers and dreadfulness that did be before us upon our way.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;209.0;and we then to look about, and soon to find a great boulder that did be set with the bushes.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;209.0;and we made our place for sleep against the boulder, and the bushes went all around, so that we did be complete hid.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;210.0;and we eat and drank, and did hark oft, and lookt out from among the bushes, but there did be naught abroad to set dread upon our spirits, and so we did be more content, and well rest and a-ready for the further journeying.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;210.0;for, indeed, as you do know, we must go nigh past the house, even did we return by the long journeying, and this to be because that the bushes did make a cover only near to the road, and all to be a country of bare rock beyond the bushes on that side of the road, which did be to the north and west.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;210.0;and we came out from among the bushes upon the north-west of the road, and crost unto the eastward side, and here the bushes to grow very plentiful, so that i led on with a cheerfulness of hope within my heart.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;210.0;and alway i went so far to the south-east as the bushes would give us their cover, and this way i made that we should scarce to pass within a great mile of the dread and horrid house, though, in verity, this to be most dreadful close.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;210.0;and we kept so far outward from the house as we might, but could pass it not more than a great mile off, because that the bushes did have their margin near upon our left, as we went, and there to be barenness of rock beyond, and fire-holes in this part and that amid the starkness of the rocky spaces, that should be like to show us very plain, if that we came outward from the bushes.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;211.0;and we to have need alway now to remember this tower, and to keep the more so to the sheltered hiding of the bushes.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;211.0;and in the eleventh hour, we did go creeping from bush unto bush, and did be as shadows that went in the mixt greyness and odd shinings of that land.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;211.0;and there did a seeming of unholiness to brood in the air, and a sense of all and deathly knowledge, so that, surely, our hiding did seem but a futile thing unto our spirits, for it was to us as that we did be watched quiet and alway by a power, as we slipt gentle from bush unto bush.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;211.0;and i set free the diskos from my hip, and had it in mine arms beside the maid, and i strode forward out of the bushes, and put forth my strength that i journey with an utter speed.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;211.0;and one hope only had i, that i bring her yet living into the shelter of the mighty refuge, and so, swift, to the care of the doctors.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;212.0;and surely i sped forever through the dreadful hours, and went neither to the right nor to the left, neither did i strive to hide in the bushes nor to evade aught, for i knew that the maid died slowly in mine arms, and there to be no more gain in life, save by speed, that i have her swift to the mighty pyramid to the care of the doctors.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;212.0;and surely i sped forever through the dreadful hours, and went neither to the right nor to the left, neither did i strive to hide in the bushes nor to evade aught, for i knew that the maid died slowly in mine arms, and there to be no more gain in life, save by speed, that i have her swift to the mighty pyramid to the care of the doctors.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;214.0;and surely the unity of love of the millions did make a natural force about me, for, in verity, the force that did come from the house to seem to be somewhat eased from the maid, yet there to be no surety in this, for all did be desperation and turmoil in my heart, and i to have but one thought in my brain, that i bring mine own swift across the land unto the mighty pyramid, and so unto the doctors.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;215.0;and i did see the hands plain in the light from the fire-hole, and the hands were monstrous, and did be armed brutish with horrid claws, so that the man should have been able to rip aught, even as a wild beast.
claw;Amniota;body;PG10662;215.0;and i did see the hands plain in the light from the fire-hole, and the hands were monstrous, and did be armed brutish with horrid claws, so that the man should have been able to rip aught, even as a wild beast.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10662;215.0;and surely, after that, i did seem to go smiting forever, for there to come, time and oft, strange things out from the bushes and the rocks, as that all the land did be a-crawl with foul and monstrous life, and i to go smiting, as in a dream, and to speed forward ever with a more fierce despair, for surely the end of our lives did be come, and i not to be given power to save mine own maid.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10662;216.0;and there came to my view a vast pack of the hounds unto my left, and they came running at a great pace, and their heads did be low, and they to be so great as horses, and seen plain, and again in shadow, all in the same moment, as they did come.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG10662;216.0;and again i lookt with my hope gone, unto the pyramid, for the hounds did be scarce two hundred fathoms off from me, and there did be hundreds of the mighty beasts.
swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10662;218.0;and all this as i ran, swift and wary and utter anxious.
mouse;Mus;organism;PG10662;218.0;and, truly, i slew them as that they had been no more than mice, and i had no harm, neither so much as a touch from them.
mouse;Muridae;organism;PG10662;218.0;and, truly, i slew them as that they had been no more than mice, and i had no harm, neither so much as a touch from them.
pig;Sus;organism;PG10662;218.0;and the diskos did spin and roar, and made a strange light upon the faces of the men, and they to have tusks like to the tusks of pigs.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG11521;47.0;in this i find a great difficulty for many reasons, in the first place, because i have not the aptitude of expressing myself in writing, and it may well be that the phrases i employ may fail in the correctness which good french requires, and again, because it is my misfortune not to agree in all points with my martin, though i am proud to think that he is, in every relation of life, so good a man, that the women of his family need not hesitate to follow his advice--but necessarily there are some points which one reserves, and i cannot but feel the closeness of the connection between the late remarkable exhibition of the power of heaven and the outrage done upon the good sisters of st. jean by the administration, of which unfortunately my son is at the head.
martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG11521;47.0;i say unfortunately, since it is the spirit of independence and pride in him which has resisted all the warnings offered by divine providence, and which refuses even now to right the wrongs of the sisters of st. jean, though, if it may be permitted to me to say it, as his mother, it was very fortunate in the late troubles that martin dupin found himself at the head of the commune of semur--since who else could have kept his self-control as he did?

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG11521;48.0;i will also admit that when it was first made apparent to me--not by the sounds of voices which the others heard, but by the use of my reason which i humbly believe is also a gift of god--that the way in which i could best serve both those of the city and my son martin, who is over them, was to lead the way with the children and all the helpless to la clairiere, thus relieving the watchers, there was for a time a great struggle in my bosom.
martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG11521;48.0;what were they all to me, that i should desert my martin, my only son, the child of my old age, he who is as his father, as dear, and yet more dear, because he is his father's son?
martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG11521;48.0;when i turned my back upon my martin, when i went away to shelter, to peace, leaving my son thus in face of an offended heaven and all the invisible powers, do you suppose it was a whole heart i carried in my breast?

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;it is ordinarily useless to expect to see the lion actually on his prey.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;the feeding is done before dawn, after which the lion enjoys stretching out in the open until the sun is well up, and then retiring to the nearest available cover.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;in an undisturbed country, or one not much hunted, the early morning hours up to say nine o'clock are quite likely to show you lions sauntering leisurely across the open plains toward their lairs.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;where the country has been much hunted, however, the lion learns to abandon his kill and seek shelter before daylight, and is almost never seen abroad.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;in the actual hunting of his game the lion is apparently very clever.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;in a rough country, or one otherwise favourable to the method, a pack of lions will often deliberately drive game into narrow ravines or cul de sacs where the killers are waiting.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;at such times the man favoured by the chance of an encampment within five miles or so can hear a lion's roar.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;no lion is fool enough to make a noise when he is stalking.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;but when seven or eight lions roar merely to see how much noise they can make, as when driving game, or trying to stampede your oxen on a wagon trip, the effect is something tremendous.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;lions again as to the dangers of lion hunting it is also difficult to write.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;there is no question that a cool man, using good judgment as to just what he can or cannot do, should be able to cope with lion situations.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;37.0;the modern rifle is capable of stopping the beast, provided the bullet goes to the right spot.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;such a man, barring sheer accidents, should be able to hunt lions with absolute certainty for just as long as he does not get careless, slipshod or over-confident.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;but to the man not temperamentally qualified, lion shooting is dangerous enough.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;the lion, when he takes the offensive, intends to get his antagonist.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;37.0;the realization that it is the man's life or the beast's is disconcerting.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;also the charging lion is a spectacle much more awe-inspiring in reality than the most vivid imagination can predict.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;it suddenly seems most undesirable to allow that lion to come any closer, not even an inch!
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;37.0;a hasty, nervous shot misses-- an unwounded lion charging from a distance is said to start rather slowly, and to increase his pace only as he closes.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;37.0;personally i have never been charged by an unwounded beast, but i can testify that the wounded animal comes very fast.

animal;Animalia;organism;PG1378;38.0;a hit seemed, in my experience, to the animal, by sheer force of impact, long enough to permit me to throw in another cartridge.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;he does not want that lion to get an inch nearer, he fires at too long a range, misses, and is killed or mauled before he can reload.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;38.0;they were armed with double-rifles, let them off hastily as the beast started at them from two hundred yards, and never got another chance.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;if they had possessed the experience to have waited until the lion had come within fifty yards they would have had the almost certainty of four barrels at close range.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;though i have seen a lion missed clean well inside those limits.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;from such performances are so-called lion accidents built.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;during my stay in africa i heard of six white men being killed by lions, and a number of others mauled.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;i believe i should be quite safe in saying that from identically the same circumstances any of the good lion men-tarleton, lord delamere, the hills, and others-would have extricated themselves unharmed.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;one may unexpectedly meet the lion at too close quarters, a foot may slip, or a cartridge prove defective.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;no rules can be given for this, nor am i trying to write a text book for lion hunters.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;any good lion hunter knows a lot more about it than i do.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;but always a man must keep in mind three things,that a lion can hide in cover so short that it seems to the novice as though a jack-rabbit would find scant concealment there, that he charges like lightning, and that he can spring about fifteen feet.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;38.0;this spring, coming unexpectedly from an unseen beast, is about impossible to avoid.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;sheer luck may land a fatal shot, but even then the lion will probably do his damage before he dies.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;no matter how long it takes, he determines absolutely that the lion is not within that distance.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;38.0;as i have said, the amount of cover necessary to conceal a lion is astonishingly small.
grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG1378;38.0;he can flatten himself out surprisingly, and his tawny colour blends so well with the brown grasses that he is practically invisible.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;39.0;after all, lion hunting is on a different plane from ordinary shooting,it is a challenge to war, a deliberate seeking for mortal combat.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;39.0;perhaps excitement and a slight doubt as to whether or not you are going to survive do not appeal to you, but nevertheless you would like a lion skin or so.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;39.0;by all means shoot one lion, or two, or three in the safest fashion you can.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;39.0;the surest way to get a lion is to kill a zebra, cut holes in him, fill the holes with strychnine, and come back next morning.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;39.0;if you want to kill a lion or so quite safely, and at the same time enjoy a glorious and exciting gallop with lots of accompanying row, by all means follow the sport with hounds.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;39.0;poison and hounds are the sure methods of finding any lion there may be about, and after the first few, one is about as justifiable as the other.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;39.0;the third safe method of killing a lion is nocturnal.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG1378;39.0;you lay out a kill beneath a tree, and climb the tree.
donkey;Equus asinus;organism;PG1378;39.0;or better, you hitch out a pig or donkey as live bait.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;39.0;when the lion comes to this free lunch, you try to see him, and, if you succeed in that, you try to shoot him.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;39.0;furthermore, lions only occasionally bother to come to bait.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG1378;39.0;you may roost up that tree many nights before you get a chance.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;40.0;there is more to this, for you are afoot, must generally search out your beast in nearby cover, and can easily find any amount of excitement in the process.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;40.0;the fourth way is to ride the lion.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG1378;40.0;at once he spurs his horse in pursuit.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;40.0;the lion will run but a short distance before coming to a stop, for he is not particularly long either of wind or of patience.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;40.0;when the lion gets tired of chasing, which he does in a very short time, the hunter faces about.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;40.0;quite likely he must now stand a charge afoot, and drop his beast before it gets to him.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;40.0;to begin with, the hunter at this game generally has companions to back him,often he employs mounted somalis to round the lion up and get it to stand.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;40.0;the charging lion is quite apt to make for the conspicuous mounted men-who can easily escape-ignoring the hunter afoot.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;40.0;as the game is largely played in the open, the movements of the beast are easily followed.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;40.0;the hunter, for example, should never follow directly in the rear of his lion, but rather at a parallel course off the beast's flank.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;40.0;then, if the lion stops suddenly, the man does not overrun before he can check his mount.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;40.0;he should never dismount nearer than a hundred and fifty yards from the embayed animal, and should never try to get off while the lion is moving in his direction.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG1378;40.0;he should never dismount nearer than a hundred and fifty yards from the embayed animal, and should never try to get off while the lion is moving in his direction.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;40.0;it is difficult to hold the front bead steady, and it is still more difficult to remember to wait, once the lion charges, until he has come near enough for a sure shot.
beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;40.0;the hunter, however, who employs a dozen somalis to ride the beast to a standstill, after which he goes to the front, has eliminated much of the thrill.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG1378;40.0;this requires that your gunbearer should be an expert trailer, for, outside the fact that following a soft-padded animal over all sorts of ground is a very difficult thing to do, the hunter should be free to spy ahead.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;40.0;but on the other hand there is in this sport a continuous keen thrill to be enjoyed in no other, and he who single handed tracks down and kills his lion thus, has well earned the title of shikari-the hunter.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG1378;40.0;to all intents and purposes we were on a rolling grassy plain, with low hills and cliffs, and a most beautiful little stream running down it beneath fine trees.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG1378;41.0;owing to the abundance of cover it was very nervous work, for the beast might be almost anywhere, and would certainly charge.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;42.0;we had proceeded thus for half a mile when to our relief, right ahead of us, sounded the commanding, rumbling half-roar, half-growl of the lion at bay.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG1378;43.0;for five hours we hung at the heels of that band of lions, moving very slowly, perfectly willing to halt whenever they told us to, and going forward again only when we became convinced that they too had gone on.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG13909;45.0;i knew, as i heard the thud of the hoofs on the road, that by the time the first reddening rays reached over the horizon he would be at the convent, seeking the woman who was all the world to him.
coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG13909;46.0;she caught up a bit of toast from the table, poured out a cup of coffee, and, still moving about, began a light breakfast, with every sign of appetite and enjoyment.
coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG13909;47.0;the duchess set down the cup of coffee which she had been sipping.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG13909;49.0;i seized the opportunity to suggest that i should be a material witness, and urged him to give me one of the duke's horses to carry me to avranches.
animal;Animalia;organism;PG13909;49.0;he grumbled at my request, declaring that i should end by getting him into trouble, but a few francs overcame his scruples, and he provided me with a sturdy animal, which i promised to bring or send back in the course of the day.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG13909;49.0;i thanked him, bowed myself out, mounted again, and rode to the hotel, where i left my horse with instructions for its return to its owner.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG13909;50.0;i was, i think, half-mad with anger and bewilderment, for i did not think that it would be time well spent to ascend to the town and obtain a vehicle or a horse, but i pressed on afoot, weary and in pain as i was, along the hot white road.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG13909;50.0;it was caused by a man on a horse--and the man was not the duke.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG13909;50.0;he reined in his horse and greeted me--and he greeted me without surprise, but not without apparent displeasure.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG13909;51.0;he cried, and he put his horse to a quick walk to keep up with me.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG13909;55.0;the old lady has ordered coffee for two in the sitting-room, and bids me rouse the duke when it is ready,so perhaps the young lady will be left alone for a time.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG13909;63.0;then, guided by the smoke which issued from the bushes, i darted across to the low stone wall and vaulted on to the top of it.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG13909;63.0;i dived into the bushes, parting them with head and hand,i was conscious of a man's form rushing by me, but i could pay no heed to him, for right in front of me, in the act of re-loading his pistol, i saw the burly inn-keeper jacques bontet.
bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG13909;63.0;spending on him and his state no more thought that they deserved, i snatched his pistol from him,for mine was broken at the junction of barrel and stock,, and, without waiting to load,and indeed with one hand helpless and in the agitation which i was suffering it would have taken me more than a moment,, i hastened back to the wall, and, parting the bushes, looked over.

sheep;Ovis aries;organism;PG13909;66.0;and i told him what had happened, as i conceived it--how that bontet must have given shelter to pierre, till such time as escape might be possible, but how that, when bontet discovered that the necklace was in the inn, the two scoundrels, thinking that they might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb, had determined to make another attempt to secure the coveted spoil, how, in pursuance of this scheme, bontet had, as i believed, suppressed the duke's message to his friends at pontorson, with the intent to attack us, as they had done, on the sands, and i added that he himself knew, better than i, what was likely to have become of the necklace in the hands of mme. delhasse.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG14851;103.0;as we receded, we saw the girl slowly wending her way towards the old thatched cottage, which showed its gable from the side of a little rugged eminence embowered in spreading trees, and dangling and twirling from its string on the end of her finger the key for which a battle had so nearly been fought.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG14851;103.0;our path lay by the river bank, and as we proceeded, the dwarf timber was succeeded by grander trees, which crowded closer and taller, and, at last, the scenery deepened into solemn forest, and a sudden sweep in the river revealed the beautiful ruin of a steep old bridge, with the fragments of a gate-house on the farther side.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG14851;104.0;away then, with many a jump and fling, scampered milly's queer white stockings and navvy boots across the irregular and precarious stepping-stones, over which i dared not follow her, so i was fain to return to the stone so 'pure and flat,' on which i sat, enjoying the grand sylvan solitude, the dark background and the grey bridge mid-way, so tall and slim, across whose ruins a sunbeam glimmered, and the gigantic forest trees that slumbered round, opening here and there in dusky vistas, and breaking in front into detached and solemn groups.
oak;Quercus;organism;PG14851;104.0;his face was rugged and wrinkled, and tanned to the tint of old oak, his eyes black, beadlike, and fierce, and a shock of sooty hair escaped from under his battered wide-awake nearly to his shoulders.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG14851;106.0;sit you down beside me and i'll tell you why i begin with one part and not another, and you'll see how i make trees and the river, and--yes, that pencil, it is hard and answers for the fine light lines, but we must begin at the beginning, and learn to copy drawings before we attempt real views like this.
walking-stick;Phasmatidae;organism;PG14851;106.0;with a stout walking-stick in his hand, and a short shooting-coat, and a wide-awake hat in much better trim than zamiel's, he emerged from the copse that covered the bridge, walking at a quick but easy pace.
lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG14851;106.0;'he'll be goin' to see old snoddles, i guess,' said milly, looking a little frightened and curious, for milly, i need not say, was a bumpkin, and stood in awe of this gentleman's good-breeding, though she was as brave as a lion, and would have fought the philistines at any odds, with the jawbone of an ass.
cat;Felis;organism;PG14851;107.0;oh, no, not that,' he laughed, as accidentally the page blew over, 'that's the cat and fiddle, a curious little pot-house, where they gave me some very good ale one day.'

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;113.0;that night i talked the matter over with mary quince.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG14851;113.0;but that night i was nervous and wakeful, and it was past two o'clock when i fancied i heard the sound of horses and carriage-wheels on the avenue.
quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;113.0;mary quince was close by, and therefore i was not afraid to get up and peep from the window.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG14851;114.0;i returned to the window, but the carriage and horses had disappeared.
quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;114.0;i was strongly tempted to wake mary quince, and take counsel with her, and persuade her to undertake a reconnoissance.
quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;114.0;'i came to tell miss quince her breakfast's ready,' said the old lady.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG14851;115.0;while at our drawing, we saw the swarthy face, sooty locks, and old weather-stained red coat of zamiel, who was glowering malignly at us from among the trunks of the forest trees, and standing motionless as a monumental figure in the side aisle of a cathedral.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG14851;116.0;as we returned, in passing a clump of trees, we heard a sudden outbreak of voices, angry and expostulatory, and saw, under the trees, the savage old zamiel strike his daughter with his stick two great blows, one of which was across the head.
palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG14851;116.0;the girl remained where she had stood, wiping the blood off roughly with the palm of her hand, and looking at it before she rubbed it on her apron.
apple;Malus domestica;organism;PG14851;116.0;'and you must have these apples--won't you?'
apple;Malus domestica;organism;PG14851;116.0;we had brought in our basket two or three of those splendid apples for which bartram was famous.

apple;Malus domestica;organism;PG14851;116.0;she continued to look doggedly at us with the same expression, and kicked away the apples sullenly that approached her feet.

windmill;Allionia;organism;PG14851;117.0;so i described the scene which had shocked milly and me, an hour or so ago, in the windmill wood.
fly;Diptera;organism;PG14851;118.0;'your ugly doctor's gone away in a fly,' said milly, as we met on the stairs, she running up, i down.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG14851;118.0;'i know, and the carriage and horses have not come, how soon are they expected?'
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG14851;119.0;have you horses to ride?'
quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;119.0;i remembered something in the will about it, and mary quince was constantly grumbling that 'he did not spend a pound a week on our board.'
fly;Diptera;organism;PG14851;120.0;'here's my fly at the door, and you must--you must',he was looking at his watch,--'mind you must think of it seriously, and so, you see, don't let anyone see that.

fly;Diptera;organism;PG14851;120.0;the fly, with the doctor's valise on top, vanished, and i sighed an anxious sigh.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG14851;120.0;the shadow of the over-arching trees contracted, and i felt helpless and forsaken, and glancing down the torn leaf, doctor bryerly's address met my eye, between my fingers.
ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG14851;121.0;then, in positive terror, lest some one should even knock during the operation, i, with a match, consumed to ashes the tell-tale bit of paper.
quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;121.0;i was always on the point of betraying it apropos des bottes --always reproaching myself for my duplicity, and in constant terror when honest mary quince approached the press, or good-natured milly made her occasional survey of the wonders of my wardrobe.
quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;121.0;'some one left here last night, i think, miss,' said mary quince, with a mysterious nod, one morning.
pepper;Capsicum frutescens;organism;PG14851;121.0;''twas two o'clock, and i was bad with the toothache, and went down to get a pinch o' red pepper--leaving the candle a-light here lest you should awake.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG14851;121.0;when i was coming up--as i was crossing the lobby, at the far end of the long gallery--what should i hear, but a horse snorting, and some people a-talking, short and quiet like.
horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG14851;121.0;so i looks out o' the window, and there surely i did see two horses yoked to a shay, and a fellah a-pullin' a box up o' top, and out comes a walise and a bag, and i think it was old wyat, please'm, that miss milly calls l'amour, that stood in the doorway a-talking to the driver.'
quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;121.0;it was very provoking, however, that mary quince had not had resolution to wait for the appearance of the traveller.
quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;121.0;we all agreed, however, that we were to observe a strict silence, and that even to wyat--l'amour i had better continue to call her--mary quince was not to hint what she had seen.

heron;Ardea;organism;PG14851;125.0;by-and-by, when milly was gesticulating to frighten some herons by the river's brink into the air, cousin monica said confidentially to me-- 'he has run away, i'm told--i wish i could believe it--and enlisted in a regiment going to india, perhaps the best thing for him.
quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;125.0;there's an old women we don't like, old wyat, she is cross and mysterious and tells untruths, but i don't think she is dishonest--so mary quince says--and that, you know, is a point, and there is a family, father and daughter, called hawkes, who live in the windmill wood, who are perfect savages, though my uncle says they don't mean it, but they are very disagreeable, rude people, and except them we see very little of the servants or other people.

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG14851;125.0;but there has been a mysterious visit, some one came late at night, and remained for some days, though milly and i never saw them, and mary quince saw a chaise at the side-door at two o'clock at night.'
heron;Ardea;organism;PG14851;125.0;and just then milly joined us, shouting to us to look at the herons flying, so cousin monica did, and smiled and nodded in thanks to milly, and was again silent and thoughtful as we walked on.
dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG14851;126.0;about once a fortnight a letter from honest mrs. rusk conveyed to me how the dogs and ponies were, in queer english, oddly spelt, some village gossip, a critique upon doctor clay's or the curate's last sermon, and some severities generally upon the dissenters' doings, with loves to mary quince, and all good wishes to me.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG14851;126.0;i had received, about a month after my arrival, a copy of verses in the same hand, in a plaintive ballad style, of the soldierly sort, in which the writer said, that as living his sole object was to please me, so dying i should be his latest thought, and some more poetic impieties, asking only in return that when the storm of battle had swept over, i should 'shed a tear' on seeing 'the oak lie , where it fell.'
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG14851;127.0;the captain was unmistakably indicated, and i was so moved that i could no longer retain my secret, but walking with milly that day, confided the little romance to that unsophisticated listener, under the chestnut trees.

willet;Tringa semipalmata;organism;PG14851;129.0;next morning, when our breakfast was nearly ended, dudley tapped at the window with the end of his clay pipe--a 'churchwarden' milly called it--just such a long curved pipe as joe willet is made to hold between his lips in those charming illustrations of 'barnaby rudge'--which we all know so well--and lifting his 'wide-awake' with a burlesque salutation, which, i suppose, would have charmed the 'plume of feathers,' he dropped, kicked and caught his 'wide-awake,' with an agility and gravity, as he replaced it, so inexpressibly humorous, that milly went off in a loud fit of laughter, with the ejaculation-- 'did you ever?'

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG14851;141.0;his hand still rested on the window, and the rev. sprigge biddlepen was standing with a saddened smirk on the door steps, when the whip smacked, the horses scrambled into motion, and away we rolled down the avenue, leaving behind us the pleasantest house and hostess in the world, and trotting fleetly into darkness towards bartram-haugh.

rail;Rallidae;organism;PG17769;106.0;next morning, punctual at the early breakfast-hour of those days, the cheery voice of the old rector was heard at the garden rails that fronted the house, and out ran tom clinton, from the stable-yard, and bid his 'raverence,' with homely phrase, and with a pleasant grin, 'welcome home,' and held his bridle and stirrup, while the parson, with a kind smile, and half a dozen enquiries, and the air of a man who, having made a long journey and a distant sojourn, expands on beholding old faces and the sights of home again, he had been away, to be sure, only one night and a part of a day, but his heart clave to his home and his darling, and lilias ran to the garden gate to meet him, with her old smile and greeting, it seemed fonder and more tender than ever, and then they kissed and hugged and kissed again, and he patted her cheek and thought she looked a little pale, but would not say anything just then that was not altogether cheerful, and so they stepped up the two or three yards of gravel walk--she at his right side, with her right hand in his and her left clinging by his arm, and nestling close by his side, and leading him up to the house like a beloved captive.
tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG17769;106.0;and so at breakfast he narrated all his adventures, and told who were at the dinner party, and described two fine ladies' dresses--for the doctor had skill in millinery, though it was as little known as don quixote's talent for making bird-cages and tooth-picks, confided, as we remember, in one of his conversations with honest sancho, under the cork trees.
lily;Lilium;organism;PG17769;106.0;he told her his whole innocent little budget of gossip, in his own simple, pleasant way, and his little lily sat looking on her beloved old man, and smiling, but saying little, and her eyes often filling with tears, and he looked, when he chanced to see it--wistfully and sadly for an instant, but he made no remark.
lily;Lilium;organism;PG17769;106.0;and sometime after, as she happened to pass the study-door, he called her--'little lily, come here.'
lily;Lilium;organism;PG17769;106.0;and in she came, and there was the doctor, all alone and erect before his bookshelves, plucking down a volume here, and putting up one there, and-- 'shut the door, little lily,' said he gently and cheerily, going on with his work.
lily;Lilium;organism;PG17769;106.0;'i had a letter yesterday evening, my darling, from captain devereux, and he tells me that he's very much attached to you, and i don't wonder at his being in love with little lily--he could not help it.'
lily;Lilium;organism;PG17769;106.0;and now, now it was come, and little lily was actually going to be married--going away--and her place would know her no more, and her greeting and her music would be missed in the evening, and the garden lonely, and the elms dark, without lily.
lily;Lilium;organism;PG17769;106.0;'and he wants to marry my little lily, if she'll have him.
lily;Lilium;organism;PG17769;106.0;'my darling, you're my darling, and your little lily will never, never leave you.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG17769;107.0;so little lily ran away, and up stairs, and as she left the study and its beloved tenant, at every step the air seemed to darken round her, and her heart to sink.
elm;Ulmus;organism;PG17769;107.0;aunt rebecca called at the elms to see lilias walsingham, and sat down beside her on the sofa.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG17769;108.0;it was now lily's turn to look pale for a moment, and then to blush so much that her ears tingled, and her eyes dropped to the carpet.
lily;Lilium;organism;PG17769;108.0;she had time to recover, though, for aunt becky, as i've said, was looking straight before her, a little pale, awaiting the result of lily's presumed ruminations.

roach;Rutilus;organism;PG17769;195.0;this she did, in a severe mood, with her attorney, and good father roach, and though mahony's statement was declamatory rather than precise, and dealt more with his feelings than his resources, and was carried on more in the way of an appeal to the 'leedy' than as an exposition to the man of law, leaving matters at the end in certainly no clearer state than before he began, yet the executrix consented to see the imprisoned youth once more, this time dispensing with her attorney's attendance, and content with the protection of the priest, and even upon that, on some subsequent visits, she did not insist.
roach;Rutilus;organism;PG17769;195.0;father roach, still officiating as internuncio, found the dowager less and less impracticable, and at length a treaty was happily concluded.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG17769;196.0;so, with a sigh, he made up his mind, got quietly into his surtout and mufflers which hung on the peg behind the hall-door, clapped on his hat, grasped his stout oak stick, and telling his housekeeper to let them know, in case his guests should miss him, that he was obliged to go out for ten minutes or so on parish business, forth sallied the stout priest, with no great appetite for knight-errantry, but still anxious to rescue, if so it might be, the distressed princess, begirt with giants and enchanters, at the mills.

bird;Aves;organism;PG17769;198.0;and with this valediction the priest departed, and from the road he looked back at the familiar outline of the mills, and its thick clumps of chimneys, and two twinkling lights, and thought of the horrible and sudden change that had passed over the place and the inmates, and how a dreadful curse had scathed them,making it, till lately the scene of comfort and tranquillity, to become the hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
